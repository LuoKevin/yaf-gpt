And I believe it in part,  19  for there must be factions among you in order that those who are genuine among you may be recognized.  20  When you come together, it is not the Lord's supper that you eat.  21  For in eating, each one goes ahead with his own meal. One goes hungry, another gets drunk.  22  What! Do you not have houses to eat and drink in? Or do you despise the church of God and humiliate those who have nothing? What shall I say to you? Shall I commend you in this? No, I will not.\n23  For I received from the Lord what I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus on the night when he was betrayed took bread,  24  and when he had given thanks, he broke it, and said, “This is my body, which is for you. Do this in remembrance of me.”  25  In the same way also he took the cup, after supper, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me.”  26  For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes.\n27  Whoever, therefore, eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty concerning the body and blood of the Lord.  28  Let a person examine himself, then, and so eat of the bread and drink of the cup.  29  For anyone who eats and drinks without discerning the body eats and drinks judgment on himself.  30  That is why many of you are weak and ill, and some have died.  31  But if we judged ourselves truly, we would not be judged.  32  But when we are judged by the Lord, we are disciplined so that we may not be condemned along with the world.\n33  So then, my brothers, when you come together to eat, wait for one another—  34  if anyone is hungry, let him eat at home—so that when you come together it will not be for judgment. About the other things I will give directions when I come.\nIcebreaker: When should the first snow happen?\nRead the passage\nAny questions about the passage?\nWhat factions or divisions is Paul referring to? What behavior is the problem?\nRich and poor Christians in the church. There are people (most likely rich) who are indulging themselves and eating all of the food/drink before others are able to join.\nWhat attitude does Paul want them to have during gatherings?\nInstead of selfishly indulging, Paul wants them to have greater regard for one another. Paul wants them to actually practice unity when they meet together. Don’t forget one another over the food or otherwise.\nWhat is communion? How are the Corinthians incorrectly treating communion?\nCommunion is a practice instituted by Jesus for Christians to remember his death and resurrection. It serves as a representation of his sacrificed body and shed blood. The way that the Corinthians are behaving is making them fail to take the Lord’s supper (v20). They’re not examining themselves in a manner that corresponds to proper posture for communion.\nWhat does Paul want people to do before taking communion? What does this mean in the context of this passage?\nHe wants them to examine themselves. Typically we take this as looking at our own lives and our own sinfulness. But Paul challenges the Corinthians to think about how they’re treating the body of believers. Not simply an inward, ‘me and God’ practice, but one that looks at how we’re interacting with other believers.\nHow can we practice regarding one another more in our fellowship? Or being more mindful/aware of one another?\nWe want people to feel included and seen, particularly when we’re together.\nSome may not have the finances to eat out all the time or at certain places.\nFellowship events shouldn’t ALWAYS be catered to a certain type of person.\nHow do we fellowship without having to be BFFs with everyone?", "source_path": "1 Corinthians/1 Cor 11.docx"}

If the whole body were an ear, where would be the sense of smell? 18 But as it is, God arranged the members in the body, each one of them, as he chose. 19 If all were a single member, where would the body be? 20 As it is, there are many parts, yet one body.\n21 The eye cannot say to the hand, “I have no need of you,” nor again the head to the feet, “I have no need of you.” 22 On the contrary, the parts of the body that seem to be weaker are indispensable, 23 and on those parts of the body that we think less honorable we bestow the greater honor, and our unpresentable parts are treated with greater modesty, 24 which our more presentable parts do not require. But God has so composed the body, giving greater honor to the part that lacked it, 25 that there may be no division in the body, but that the members may have the same care for one another. 26 If one member suffers, all suffer together; if one member is honored, all rejoice together.\n27 Now you are the body of Christ and individually members of it. 28 And God has appointed in the church first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then miracles, then gifts of healing, helping, administrating, and various kinds of tongues. 29 Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Do all work miracles? 30 Do all possess gifts of healing? Do all speak with tongues? Do all interpret? 31 But earnestly desire the higher gifts.\nAnd I will show you a still more excellent way.\nIcebreaker: If you were a kitchen utensil, what would you be?\nRead the passage\nAny questions about the passage?\nWhat’s the deal with spiritual gifts at Corinth?\nCorinthians are gifted but still not spiritually mature\nThey see some gifts being more superior than others\nThey’re confused about the source of their gifts (pagan or otherwise)\nGifts are being used inappropriately which is causing division\nHow does Paul want us to treat the “lesser” or “weaker” gifts? Why?\nVerse 24-25 - he wants us to give greater honor\nSo that there is unity and care for one another\nThis exhortation fits into the larger message of this letter and fits with the issues that Corinth is dealing with. The gifts are meant for the body, even the ones that are ‘lesser’.\nWhat’s required for v26 to happen in real life? How can we foster this in YAF?\nIt requires people to know one another and be in each others’ lives. We cannot know what happens (suffering or otherwise) in another brother/sister unless there is a relationship. As trust builds, we also need to exercise courage to share and allow people to see what’s going on in our lives.\nCompare list of gifts in v28 versus v8-10. What is Paul trying to communicate with this new list?\nThe second list includes gifts that are less supernatural, arguably more ‘boring.’ Paul wants to expand the view of gifting. The Corinthians might highly value the supernatural ones leading to marginalization of the ‘boring’ gifts. Again, striving for unity in the church.\nHow do we know our gift?\nSome possible answers (no need to have exhaustive answer for this last question):\nThrough other people pointing them and affirming\nThrough finding ourselves in situations to exercise certain gifts\nThrough unique willingness or ease to serve in areas compared to other people", "source_path": "1 Corinthians/1 Cor 12 Part 2.docx"}

These are things we should seek and practice for the benefit of the church. At the same time, we cannot overvalue the gifts making them ultimate goals. Paul tells us that they are uniquely given by God, meaning we cannot ‘force’ God to give us certain gifts.

The one who prophesies is greater than the one who speaks in tongues, unless someone interprets, so that the church may be built up.\n6  Now, brothers, if I come to you speaking in tongues, how will I benefit you unless I bring you some revelation or knowledge or prophecy or teaching?  7  If even lifeless instruments, such as the flute or the harp, do not give distinct notes, how will anyone know what is played?  8  And if the bugle gives an indistinct sound, who will get ready for battle?  9  So with yourselves, if with your tongue you utter speech that is not intelligible, how will anyone know what is said? For you will be speaking into the air.  10  There are doubtless many different languages in the world, and none is without meaning,  11  but if I do not know the meaning of the language, I will be a foreigner to the speaker and the speaker a foreigner to me.  12  So with yourselves, since you are eager for manifestations of the Spirit, strive to excel in building up the church.\n13  Therefore, one who speaks in a tongue should pray that he may interpret.  14  For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays but my mind is unfruitful.  15  What am I to do? I will pray with my spirit, but I will pray with my mind also; I will sing praise with my spirit, but I will sing with my mind also.  16  Otherwise, if you give thanks with your spirit, how can anyone in the position of an outsider say “Amen” to your thanksgiving when he does not know what you are saying?  17  For you may be giving thanks well enough, but the other person is not being built up.  18  I thank God that I speak in tongues more than all of you.  19  Nevertheless, in church I would rather speak five words with my mind in order to instruct others, than ten thousand words in a tongue.\n20  Brothers, do not be children in your thinking.

What is sown is perishable; what is raised is imperishable.  43  It is sown in dishonor; it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness; it is raised in power.  44  It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual body.  45  Thus it is written, “The first man Adam became a living being”; the last Adam became a life-giving spirit.  46  But it is not the spiritual that is first but the natural, and then the spiritual.  47  The first man was from the earth, a man of dust; the second man is from heaven.  48  As was the man of dust, so also are those who are of the dust, and as is the man of heaven, so also are those who are of heaven.  49  Just as we have borne the image of the man of dust, we shall also bear the image of the man of heaven.\n50  I tell you this, brothers: flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable.  51  Behold!

O death, where is your sting?”\n56  The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law.  57  But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.\n58  Therefore, my beloved brothers, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that in the Lord your labor is not in vain.\nIcebreaker: What is the last thing you did for the first time?\nRead v35-44.

They’ll be different in brilliance and nature like heavenly bodies of space. These new bodies will not die or perish. All of these bodies are created by God.

Like Jesus, we will have new, physical bodies like Jesus’ resurrected one.\nRead v50-58. How and when will this transformation happen? Why do we need these resurrected bodies?\nV52 - it will happen instantaneously when Jesus returns at the trumpet. It will happen to all Christian whether they are dead/sleeping or alive.\nWe need these bodies to be with God. Our earthly bodies, tainted with sin and death, cannot inherit the kingdom of God or be with the imperishable or immortal. God’s holiness and glory would overwhelm our earthly bodies.\nHow is this promise of resurrected bodies relevant for us today?\nẞß gives us hope in this life so that death does not have final powerjo or victory over us (v55)\nIt serves as a basis and hopeful reason for laboring for the Lord (v58)\nBeing bold with our bodies for the gospel — we’re guaranteed a new one\nIt means that our bodies (and others’ bodies) are not the ultimate thing.

On the contrary, I worked harder than any of them, though it was not I, but the grace of God that is with me.  11  Whether then it was I or they, so we preach and so you believed.\n12  Now if Christ is proclaimed as raised from the dead, how can some of you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?  13  But if there is no resurrection of the dead, then not even Christ has been raised.  14  And if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is in vain and your faith is in vain.  15  We are even found to be misrepresenting God, because we testified about God that he raised Christ, whom he did not raise if it is true that the dead are not raised.  16  For if the dead are not raised, not even Christ has been raised.  17  And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile and you are still in your sins.  18  Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished.  19  If in Christ we have hope in this life only, we are of all people most to be pitied.\n20  But in fact Christ has been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep.  21  For as by a man came death, by a man has come also the resurrection of the dead.  22  For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive.  23  But each in his own order: Christ the firstfruits, then at his coming those who belong to Christ.  24  Then comes the end, when he delivers the kingdom to God the Father after destroying every rule and every authority and power.  25  For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet.  26  The last enemy to be destroyed is death.  27  For “God has put all things in subjection under his feet.” But when it says, “all things are put in subjection,” it is plain that he is excepted who put all things in subjection under him.  28  When all things are subjected to him, then the Son himself will also be subjected to him who put all things in subjection under him, that God may be all in all.\n29  Otherwise, what do people mean by being baptized on behalf of the dead? If the dead are not raised at all, why are people baptized on their behalf?  30  Why are we in danger every hour?  31  I protest, brothers, by my pride in you, which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die every day!  32  What do I gain if, humanly speaking, I fought with beasts at Ephesus?

Why would he describe himself as “untimely born” (v8)?\nPaul was named Saul before and was a persecutor of Christians. On a road to Damascus, a bright light shone on Saul. The people with him fell on the ground and Jesus spoke to Saul asking why Saul was persecuting him (Jesus). From there, Saul was renamed and received a commission from Jesus, changing the trajectory of Paul’s life completely. Unlike the other apostles, Paul never met Jesus while Jesus was alive. His encounter with Jesus happened after Jesus resurrected and ascended, so the latest encounter among the apostles. “Untimely born” or “abnormally born” is also a term for ‘stillbirth.’ Paul says that his relationship with Jesus is ‘premature’ because he never walked with Jesus when he was alive. The other apostles knew Jesus for much longer and resurrected Jesus was an extension. For Paul, his relationship was only through the post-resurrected Christ.\nLook at v12-19. What issue is Paul addressing? What are some consequences if there’s no bodily resurrection?\nV14 - preaching and faith are in vain\nV15 - Paul and companions are liars\nV13,16 - Then Christ isn’t resurrected\nV17 - humanity condemned in sin\nV18 - those Christians who died are eternally lost\nV19 - Christians are most pitied believing in an empty promise\nLook at v20-28. How is Paul comparing Adam and Jesus? Who is covered under the actions of Adam? Of Jesus?\nHe puts Adam and Jesus against one another. Adam is the ‘origin’ of the first death while Christ is the ‘origin’ of new life. Jesus’ resurrection undos the effect of Adam on mankind. They both cover all of humanity and representatives (or firstfruits) of all humanity.\nLook at v29-34. How does resurrection relate to “eat and drink, for tomorrow we die” (v32)?\nIf there’s no resurrection of the dead, then you only live once.

How does that set the perspective that Christians should have towards their blessings and giftings?\n-What are some practical examples of these blessings and giftings today?\nPaul wants to remind Christians about the greater promise of eternity. Christians are not limited to what is on earth. So blessings and gifting should be oriented that way as well. We’re not supposed to simply sit here and wait and sit on these blessings and enjoy them for ourselves. They are to be used in preparation for eternity. We are actively waiting for eternity, which means taking part in what God is doing here.\nFeel free to discuss the different blessings and giftings we have seen or experienced\nWhat does it mean to be called (v9)?

Where is the scribe? Where is the debater of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world?  21  For since, in the wisdom of God, the world did not know God through wisdom, it pleased God through the folly of what we preach to save those who believe.  22  For Jews demand signs and Greeks seek wisdom,  23  but we preach Christ crucified, a stumbling block to Jews and folly to Gentiles,  24  but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.  25  For the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.\n26  For consider your calling, brothers: not many of you were wise according to worldly standards, not many were powerful, not many were of noble birth.  27  But God chose what is foolish in the world to shame the wise; God chose what is weak in the world to shame the strong;  28  God chose what is low and despised in the world, even things that are not, to bring to nothing things that are,  29  so that no human being might boast in the presence of God.  30  And because of him you are in Christ Jesus, who became to us wisdom from God, righteousness and sanctification and redemption,  31  so that, as it is written, “Let the one who boasts, boast in the Lord.”\nWhat does the passage tell us about wisdom? God’s wisdom? Earthly wisdom?\n19 - God destroys the wisdom of the wise\n20 - God makes foolish the wisdom of the world\n21 - God cannot be known only through earthly intellect and wisdom**\n25 - God’s wisdom is on a completely different tier than human wisdom\n30 - Jesus becomes to us wisdom from God; Jesus is our source of God’s wisdom\n**Maybe briefly follow up asking about how we can know God. Knowing God through both intellect and experience. And exploring the weaknesses of only having one or the other.\nWhy is Christ crucified a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to Greeks?\nVerse 22 tells us what each group desired. For the Jews, a prophet or savior dying isn’t any significant sign since he’d be just a man. Also, Jesus dying on the cross (or a ‘tree’) is something that is cursed according to Deuteronomy. There’s no way the savior would be cursed.\nFor the Gentiles, since they’re about intellect and wisdom, it makes no sense to find power in a crucified criminal.\nWhy does God choose to use the weak to shame the strong/foolish to shame the wise?\nSo that no human would boast in the presence of God (v29). It is how God shows his exclusive power, and reminds human beings of their need for God. The reversal of our typical expectation of power allows God’s power to shine. We can refer to many, many stories throughout scripture.\nHow have we seen this in real life?\nHave an example in mind, whether in your own life or seen in someone else’s life where God used the weakness for something greater. NOTE: Doesn’t necessarily have to be at the ‘expense’ of someone strong/wise.\nWhat makes it hard to embrace our weakness? How can we embrace our weakness?\nWe don’t want to feel inferior or powerless. We feel better about ourselves when we know we’re better than (at the expense of) someone else. Weakness also makes us feel like we’re not in control. We’re also taught that strength and pride are high virtues.\nWe embrace our weakness with humility. This is done by looking at Christ who is the ultimate example of humility. The one who had all power empties himself of power in order to serve mankind.\n**This question is to challenge our idea of weakness. We hear about this at church frequently, but we don’t actually embrace our weakness in real life. We, by default, seek to be self-sufficient and not acknowledge our need for God.\nInstead of personal wisdom, Paul finds power in the cross\nIf you don’t believe in Jesus, this wisdom is foolish\nGod’s wisdom makes it so that people could not understand God through wisdom\nBy design, God cannot be known only through intellectual understanding. Nor can God be known just through experiential understanding.\nHow is preaching Christ’s crucifixion a stumbling block to Jews? (and also folly to Gentiles)\nWhat is true wisdom?

In the same way, no one knows the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God.  12  Now we have not received the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who comes from God, so that we may understand what has been freely given to us by God.  13  We also speak these things, not in words taught by human wisdom, but in those taught by the Spirit, explaining spiritual things to spiritual people.  14  But the person without the Spirit does not receive what comes from God’s Spirit, because it is foolishness to him; he is not able to understand it since it is evaluated spiritually.  15  The spiritual person, however, can evaluate everything, and yet he himself cannot be evaluated by anyone.  16  For\nwho has known the Lord’s mind, that he may instruct him?\nBut we have the mind of Christ.\n2:15 = non-spiritual person cannot see spiritual part of a person\nIcebreaker:  Did you watch fireworks this week? If not, when was the last time you watched?\nAny questions about the passage?\nWhat does Paul mean for some wisdom to be ‘among the mature’? How does this contrasts to how Paul speaks when he first visits Corinth in v1-5?\nThere are things and certain wisdom that Christians learn as they grow in faith. This contrasts with Paul using simpler language with the Corinthians during his first visit. Paul is purposeful to not use brilliant speech or wisdom, but instead communicate the plain gospel. This makes sense since this was his first encounter with the people at Corinth. Paul is sensitive to not communicate extra things to baby Christians. Paul is more than able to present deeper truths in elegant ways to the Christians, but they are not yet ready in their spiritual maturity.\nWhat type of wisdom do people seek today? Are these things that Christians should pursue?\nNot everyone may be intentional in seeking Wisdom everyday. For those that might seek wisdom for worldly success (i.e. career, finance management). There are also other types of wisdom: academic, philosophical. People want some wisdom to help make life better or easier. None of these pursuits are inherently problematic. But are they the ultimate thing in our lives? Do we pursue them simply for selfish reasons?\nLooking at the latter half of the chapter, what does the Spirit help reveal to us?\nThings prepared by God for those who love him (9-10)\nThe thoughts of God (11)\nThings that have been freely given to us by God (12)\nAKA, the Spirit reveals the gospel to us. The ability to discover and see Jesus is a work of the Spirit; it’s a supernatural work.\nSo who gets the credit when people find God?\nNot us; the Spirit did the actual, transformative work.\nWhy does that matter for us day to day?\nMore specifically, why does the fact that the Spirit reveals the gospel to people matter. Throw around some ideas for a while, see what people say. Land on the fact that the Spirit does the transformative work of revealing which frees us of pressure when sharing the gospel with someone. A person accepting Jesus doesn’t necessarily depend on us.\nWhat makes it hard to share the gospel? Share a time when you shared the gospel with someone; how did you feel?. Who are people in your life who need to hear the gospel? What would help us have these types of conversations more frequently?\nDecide which question is most appropriate for your group.

But some, through former association with idols, eat food as really offered to an idol, and their conscience, being weak, is defiled.  8  Food will not commend us to God. We are no worse off if we do not eat, and no better off if we do.  9  But take care that this right of yours does not somehow become a stumbling block to the weak.  10  For if anyone sees you who have knowledge eating in an idol's temple, will he not be encouraged, if his conscience is weak, to eat food offered to idols?  11  And so by your knowledge this weak person is destroyed, the brother for whom Christ died.  12  Thus, sinning against your brothers and wounding their conscience when it is weak, you sin against Christ.  13  Therefore, if food makes my brother stumble, I will never eat meat, lest I make my brother stumble.\nIcebreaker: Favorite thing at a night market (or festival or amusement park)\nRead v1-13\nAny questions about the passage?\nWhat issue is Paul addressing in this passage?\nThere are two groups that Paul is addressing. One who thinks it’s fine to eat food offered to idols and one that does not. This is leading to disagreement with each group thinking they are correct/better. Note that this is not a black and white issue.\nWhat does it mean in this context for someone to be “weak”?\n‘Weak’ is not a judgment on morality. It is not meant to make this group seem lesser or less holy. This group was adhering to extra restrictions according to their God-given conscience. Their conscience was stopping them from taking part in eating such meats, meaning for them it was sinful to take part.\nWhat are some reasons why Paul encourages “stronger” Christians to abstain?\nV8 - Eating meat is not a black and white issue; it is neutral. There is no spiritual advantage or disadvantage with meat so concern for one another should take priority.\nV11 - Flaunting your freedom is ruining the spiritual lives of the ‘weak.’ It becomes a stumbling block to the other believers and prevents them from growing. This is obviously not how the body of believers should function.\nV12 - Such disregard for fellow believers is sinning against Christ.\nFood and meat may not be an issue today, but how does this concept apply to modern Christianity?\nFor the most part, this is identifying gray areas in the faith. Be mindful and watchful of reactions in the group. Some people might think an issue is black/white rather than gray.

Likewise, he uses his freedom to adapt to different people for the sake of the gospel. Paul doesn’t utilize his freedom for himself; he chooses to serve the Corinthians and other groups of people.\nWho are ‘under the law’ and ‘outside the law’ (v20-21)?\nThree groups he mentions: Jews, Gentiles (outside the law), those ‘under the law’ are those who are in-between. Could be Gentiles who adopted Judaism or people who were just ethnically Jewish without practicing.\nWhat example is Paul setting? For what reason? Why is it smart to do this?\nPaul is flexible and adapts himself in order to ‘win’ people to Jesus. Similar to the eating meat and money situations, Paul wants to reduce any obstacle or hindrance from allowing people to come to Christ. He capitalizes on his different ‘identities’ or ‘statuses’ in order to reach a diverse audience. By being like the group, he can more easily relate to them and they are more likely to listen to him.\nWhat existing interests, hobbies, or social circles do I have that can be used to reach others?\nIf there are difficulties answering, you can just ask for impersonal examples. Same for #5.\nWe want people to think about specifics in their own lives. Everyone has certain unique things about themselves that allows them to reach a unique group of people. There are communities that we can join in order to meet people who do not have the gospel.\nIn what ways can we imitate Paul in being flexible or accommodating for the sake of the gospel? [what does this look like?]\nUnlike the previous question, this question is challenging us to step out in some way to reach people that may seem “unnatural.” Being flexible or accommodating requires us to give up something on our end, maybe something that we value or prioritize in our lives.

Is there something wrong with settling or building a tower?\nDoes God prefer wandering?\nDoes God have to ‘come down’ in order to see what they’re doing?\nWhy do the humans build the city and tower?\nWe usually learn that they have pride in wanting to make a name, but v4 says otherwise.

Not a curse! No hint of God being angry or vengeful. Almost seems like God is threatened by man’s progress. But this confusion forces them to disperse to different parts of the world… which leads to differing cultures and people groups.

She’s not one of the sons, nor is she the son of Haran. Milcah reappears in the story later on, Iscah does not. You probably won’t come to a solid answer here, but this question is to brainstorm different theories. But we know that there’s a reason for her mention. The author would not just add a woman in a genealogy for no reason.\n3) Look at Gen 9:23 and Gen 11:29 (ESV is needed). In Hebrew, in both verses, “took” is singular.

Why would Egypt be the place to go during a famine?\nMore of a cultural background question. Typically, we imagine Egypt to be a huge desert with pyramids… but the Nile is there. The Nile gives year-round access to water and crops during the dry and rainy season (no four seasons there). Going to Egypt meant access to food regardless of season.\nDescribe the plan of Abram (+Sarai)? What is the motivation (look at v13)?\nIt’s important to note the cultural expectations regarding courtship/marriage/relationships. By saying Sarai is his non-married sister, potential suitors need to come bring gifts to win the bid for Sarai. This is a way for Abram and Sarai to gain wealth. Typically, we’ve solely blamed Abram for using his wife, but v13 shows that his desire is for Sarai’s sake. Abram, as the patriarch, needs to be able to provide for his wife and his household. So perhaps Sarai was in on it but at the very least Abram is not being completely selfish.\nIs Abram justified in carrying out this plan?\nDiscuss some of the tensions. It somewhat feels Robinhood-esque in doing something morally grey to help people. Also add on that this is supposed to be a man of God who is using deception for gain.\nWhat goes wrong? Was the plan successful?\nPharaoh takes in Sarai. Pharaoh does not need to go through the same channels as other suitors; he can just take. Abram and Sarai are placed in a potentially dangerous situation. But we see God still protecting Abram (v17) and they still left Egypt with massive wealth (13:2).\nAPPS\nWhat do we learn about man’s plans through Abram/Sarai?

They cannot have children.\nIf you were Abram in this circumstance with the same promise, what would you do to fix the situation?\nSmall brainstorm in seeing Abram’s POV.

Why is this a big deal in light of the story so far? Why did Abram take Lot with him in the first place?\nThe land was too crowded and caused issues between Abram’s people and Lot’s people. Lot was Abram’s solution to the problem of having children. Sarai was barren so Abram planned to have offspring through Lot, who was still as relative. If Lot leaves, then Abram has no solution to the promise of having children.\nGen 15:2, Gen 16 are other examples where Abram/Sarai find someone else to bear children to solve the problem.\nWhat do we learn about Abram as he initiates this separation?\nAbram shows hints of greater trust in God’s plan and story.

Recall the three parts of God’s promise to Abram (refer to ch 12).\nLand, Blessing, Posterity\nWhat’s Abram’s concern in v2? How does God respond?\nAbram is again wrestling with not being able to have a son for posterity. He essentially questions God and “offers” another relative to help establish his line. After v2, God is silent. Abram has to reiterate the question. In Hebrew, since both v2 and v3 begin with “Abram said,” it implies that some time has passed between the two verses. Might be worth to wrestle with why God would want to be silent with Abram at v2.\nAccording to cultural practices, what is supposed to happen after v9-10? What does Abram do instead? Why?\nAbram is supposed to walk through the animals to seal the deal. Notice that Abram does not walk through the animals. In fact, he waits long enough for predators to smell and find the carcasses. Abram definitely knew what was expected in this covenant since it was cultural practice. He probably knew that he would not be able to keep up his end in a covenant with God and therefore didn’t want to get cut in half.\nLook at v17. In Israel’s story, where and when do fire and smoke appear? What does this event mean in light of this covenant practice?\nFire and smoke are representative of the presence of God (pillar of fire/smoke in the desert, smoke filing the tabernacle). God walks through the animal halves by himself. It is a one-sided covenant meaning God will take on the punishment regardless of who messes up keeping the covenant.\nAPPS:\nWhy does God sometimes choose to be silent with us (as he does with Abram)?\nThis application refers to the first question.

What questions or interesting things stand out?\nThree men representing singular God, why does God choose to appear and speak this way, how does Abraham figure out it is God...\nIn Abraham and Sarah’s eyes, who are these three men initially?\nThere’s no sign of the three men being God at first. Verse 1 is something that the author already knows, not necessarily what Abraham knows. They were just three men to them initially. We can also tell by Abraham addressing them as ‘Lord’ (lowercase). When ‘Lord’ refers to God it’s in all caps like v1, 10.\nHow does Abraham treat these guests? Why does Abraham react the way he does to these guests?\nExtreme generosity.

How can I create more margins in my schedule?  Follow up question:  If I do have margins, how can I better foster relationships?\nThis is an audit question to see if our schedules or the way we spend our time is not conducive to margins. Our schedules may not be packed with work, but it could be filled with “me time” or “me-oriented” activities that don’t leave room for margins or time for relational growth. To make more margins, sometimes it means saying ‘no’ to some things and sacrificing other things.\nWhat are things I can align with hospitality?\nThe easiest is meals since everyone eats. But what are other activities that we regularly enjoy individually that we could bring someone along? This question is targeted for specifics, not just activities that everyone does normally.\nWhat makes me unwilling to make margins?\nThis question is somewhat optional. If you sense your group is hesitant about giving up their schedules to make margins, this would be a good question. Or if this is something worthwhile for your group to toss around, that’s fine.\nAs a segue… you can make an argument that our small group hospitality event is alignment.

Why?\nRead Genesis 18:1-15, 19:1-14\nWho shows hospitality in these passages? To whom? How do they show it?\nComprehension: Abraham and Lot show hospitality to the guests who turn out to be angels. Abraham uses a lot of ingredients to make a feast and offers to help them wash their feet. Lot convinces the guests to stay for the night and also prepares a feast for them. Also, in a quite uncomfortable way, Lot is willing to give up his daughters for the sake of these guests. (quick note that Lot does not know that the guests will blind the Sodomites when he offers up his daughters)\nWhat is the result of allowing these individuals into their homes?\nMore comprehension: Abraham (and Sarah) receive a reminder of the promised child, remember that a lot of time has passed since they first received the promise. Lot gets protection by the guests, both in the immediate human threat and also the judgment on Sodom.\nWould it have been better or worse to let the guests pass by?\nPretty much an opinion question. Generally we see that positive things came out of having these guests over.\nWhat did it take for Abraham and Lot to show hospitality to their guests?\nWe’re looking for things that they sacrificed to show hospitality. Time, energy, resources, ingredients, comfort, Lot’s daughters, security...\nWhat things are we not willing to give up for the sake of hospitality?\nThis is looking for specific things, many of which will be similar to the list above. A simple follow up question is how they would prefer to use their ______ (time, energy, resources, etc).\nIs what we see in Abraham and Lot even worth trying to imitate today?\nThis is a reality check for us. We clearly see the extreme selflessness and sacrifice of Abraham and Lot. Is it just a nice sounding tale? Or is it something we’re actually supposed to imitate? Hopefully at this point, we see our inner conflict -- we know we should imitate but we cannot or, more accurately,  do not want  to. I’m sure for some members, their personal view of scripture will cause them to not care and not be conflicted, that’s fine for now.\nSo what is the biggest barrier? [What are we supposed to do about it? Do we just shrug and carry on?]\nHopefully we come to the conclusion that  selfishness  is the biggest barrier. We sometimes make the excuse that “culturally” it’s different today, i.e. there are more dangers nowadays. But it’s more like we’ve been culturally influenced to trust people less (not to mention that Lot’s welcoming of the guests did not put him in a “safe” situation). We make it seem like it’s “unrealistic” nowadays but arguably we are just more unwilling to make sacrifices.\n**We’re looking to point out our complacency and inner conflict with selfishness.

They aren’t the most popular ones that people will know off the top of their heads. Some examples: Both are ‘weak’ in their group, encounter marks the beginning of some sort of calling or work from God, hosting the guests, feast for the guests.\nWho shows hospitality in these passages? How do they show it? What is significant about the food they choose?\nComprehension: Gideon and Manoah showing hospitality by providing a feast, giving up time and energy for these guests. They go all out on the feast, using a young goat which is reserved for celebration (you can think about the Prodigal Son story). It’s an expensive sacrifice for these guests.\nWhat do they know about their guests as the stories progress?\nIn both cases, the guests are strangers. The hosts have no idea that they are angels of the Lord. It’s only after they do some divine or supernatural act where they realize the guests’ identities (fire + vanishing).\nHow would they respond differently if they knew initially that the Lord visited them?\nA feast would have been the absolute minimum. Their response would have more reverence. Arguably we can see their reaction based on what they do at the end of the accounts when they discover the truth.\nWhat kind of hesitancies come when considering hosting a stranger? [Did Gideon and Manoah (and Abraham and Lot) face these issues?]\nMore personal question and bringing this idea to real life. Hesitancies of safety, not wanting to sacrifice _____ (time, money, etc), general discomfort, not feeling like we have the most impressive home… The follow up question is to help establish that the Bible characters aren’t that different from us. They would also feel similar hesitancies even though the culture is different.\nConsider Leviticus 19:33-34 in combination with these stories, what are we supposed to do today?\nThis question is to help us identify the conflict between what we see in scripture and how we approach the idea of ‘strangers’ in our lives. We can make all the excuses that we want, but scripture is clear through commands and examples of what we’re supposed to do. Do we just shrug at our disobedience? Does it even bother us that our lives don’t come close to this command?

She basically has nothing to give in her situation. The Shunammite woman is wealthy and is able to give with abundance. Though she is rich, she has no son or heir (poor in a different way). Both women still host the prophet.\nWhat sacrifices were made by the women to show hospitality?\nFinancial sacrifices - although one sacrifice was MUCH harder than the other. Time and effort to feed the prophet or build the room.\nWhy would they choose to show hospitality in their situations? [What are their attitudes in showing hospitality?]\nWidow arguably “had” to based on verse 9. But she still made a choice to obey even though she already made a resolve that she was going to die so maybe dragging her feet to serve Elijah? The wife was very eager to show hospitality. She was egging her husband on to make these accommodations for Elisha.\nWhat do Elijah and Elisha learn about the respective women during their stays? What gets “exposed” about them?\nWidow’s lacking wealth gets exposed, Elijah doesn’t know that God told such a woman to feed him. Elisha finds out that the woman does not have a child and the husband is old. Culturally, it’s taboo for her to not have a son (no heir). Both situations are potential sources of shame.\nWhat kind of things can people find out about us when we show hospitality?\nCleanliness, family dynamics, house habits… Longer guests stay the more they learn about your personality or how you really act towards guests. Masks and fronts are at risk when showing hospitality.\nHow do we typically guard ourselves from getting exposed? Why do we do this?\nPivot question from talking about exposure of physical home hospitality to emotional/spiritual vulnerability. Ultimately we want to relate the idea of hospitality to vulnerability. Providing examples would be effective in getting us to think this way.\nWhat does it take for us to be vulnerable?\nWe all have different barriers that prevent us from being vulnerable.

With all of the difficulties that come with it, why should we practice hospitality?\nThis is a setup question for the study. Throw ideas around in the group. This question should help us actually engage with all the talks around hospitality. It’s not just knowledge we’re accumulating but why bother with all of these discussions?\nRead Luke 5:12-32\nWho are the people Jesus interacts with? What are their social statuses?\nLeper - has a contagious skin disease, outcast in society, literally lives outside the city away from others, lives around other lepers, not to touch/interact with anyone else, culturally supposed to announce to people they’re getting close so others walk away\nParalytic - no way to contribute to society, destined for abandonment and/or death, no means or hope of healing, cultural belief was that him or his parents did something to deserve this\nLevi/Tax Collector - low in social status, these Jews essentially worked for the Roman government, often were scammers by over-taxing people, seen as traitors\nWhat do you notice about Jesus’ interactions with the different characters?\nJesus is intentional to show care for these marginalized groups. He’s willing to draw near to them even when it’s culturally inappropriate (especially with the contagious leper, sharing food with sinners). Jesus is also willing to be interrupted by these people. His schedule as the Messiah is thrown out the window when these random people enter his sphere. Mixture of Jesus being approached and moving towards these people; he initiates the care for all of them.\nHow does this translate to how we are to interact with people? What about in relation to hospitality my\n?\nWe should be willing to get close to others, even if they seem less desirable in our minds. How often do we just exclusively gravitate to the people we feel comfortable with? We should also be willing to make time to care and be hospitable to others. Weekday meetups or hosting can seem inconvenient in our packed schedules. Just generally, we should try to actually see people.\nHow does Jesus show hospitality without actually having a home?\nLogistically he used other locations, but we see Jesus continuously practicing the core of hospitality which is care. We also see Jesus feeding people in other episodes.\nHow does Jesus show hospitality to us?\nHis death and resurrection brings us into the family of God.

It is important to observe that not all of the tribes of Israel are mentioned in this chapter, nor is each tribe described with the same level of detail. Using  Exodus 1:1–5 , write down the names of the 12 tribes of Israel and identify which tribes are missing from  Judges 1:1–36 .

So God resolves to not save them and they should find salvation from the gods they’ve chosen to worship. God wants them to realize that they cannot serve both God and these other idols. God demands exclusive loyalty and love. He wants Israel to realize that these idols cannot save them and that ‘crying out to the Lord’ demands more than just words.\nWhat does verse 16 tell us about God and Israel?\nSee if people can identify these two interpretations.

God’s people kill God’s people. There is no peace.\nWhy do you think Jephthah made the vow in the first place?\n**Spend time wrestling with questions 2-4. Throw around different ideas and theories.\nPossible follow up questions:\nIs God allowing an exception regarding human sacrifice?\nIs Jephthah justified somehow?\nHow does God view human/child sacrifice? How has God handled child sacrifice in the past? (Abraham and Isaac)\nThe vow is especially strange because God is very much against human sacrifice. Pagan practices often included human sacrifices. Perhaps Jephthah believed that it was the norm even with the Israelite God. He had a poor understanding of who God is. He wanted to appease God by using pagan god ways: give the gods something so that the gods can have mercy and rescue the people.\nWhat could Jephthah have done instead? Why do you think he still chose to keep the vow in such a horrific way?\nJephthah doesn’t think he has any other option. He could have confessed his foolishness, asked for forgiveness, and kept his daughter. But he fears that God will punish him for not keeping ‘his end of the bargain.’ Again, Jephthah doesn’t understand who God is, namely, God’s grace and mercy.\nJephthah unfortunately buys into the beliefs of the surrounding culture.

And he said, “I will go in to my wife in the chamber.” But her father would not allow him to go in. And her father said, “I really thought that you utterly hated her, so I gave her to your companion. Is not her younger sister more beautiful than she? Please take her instead.” And Samson said to them, “This time I shall be innocent in regard to the Philistines, when I do them harm.” So Samson went and caught 300 foxes and took torches. And he turned them tail to tail and put a torch between each pair of tails. And when he had set fire to the torches, he let the foxes go into the standing grain of the Philistines and set fire to the stacked grain and the standing grain, as well as the olive orchards. Then the Philistines said, “Who has done this?” And they said, “Samson, the son-in-law of the Timnite, because he has taken his wife and given her to his companion.” And the Philistines came up and burned her and her father with fire. And Samson said to them, “If this is what you do, I swear I will be avenged on you, and after that I will quit.” And he struck them hip and thigh with a great blow, and he went down and stayed in the cleft of the rock of Etam.\nThen the Philistines came up and encamped in Judah and made a raid on Lehi. And the men of Judah said, “Why have you come up against us?” They said, “We have come up to bind Samson, to do to him as he did to us.” Then 3,000 men of Judah went down to the cleft of the rock of Etam, and said to Samson, “Do you not know that the Philistines are rulers over us? What then is this that you have done to us?” And he said to them, “As they did to me, so have I done to them.” And they said to him, “We have come down to bind you, that we may give you into the hands of the Philistines.” And Samson said to them, “Swear to me that you will not attack me yourselves.” They said to him, “No; we will only bind you and give you into their hands. We will surely not kill you.” So they bound him with two new ropes and brought him up from the rock.\nWhen he came to Lehi, the Philistines came shouting to meet him. Then the Spirit of the  Lord  rushed upon him, and the ropes that were on his arms became as flax that has caught fire, and his bonds melted off his hands. And he found a fresh jawbone of a donkey, and put out his hand and took it, and with it he struck 1,000 men. And Samson said,\n“With the jawbone of a donkey,      heaps upon heaps, with the jawbone of a donkey      have I struck down a thousand men.”\nAs soon as he had finished speaking, he threw away the jawbone out of his hand. And that place was called Ramath-lehi.\nAnd he was very thirsty, and he called upon the  Lord  and said, “You have granted this great salvation by the hand of your servant, and shall I now die of thirst and fall into the hands of the uncircumcised?” And God split open the hollow place that is at Lehi, and water came out from it. And when he drank, his spirit returned, and he revived. Therefore the name of it was called En-hakkore; it is at Lehi to this day. And he judged Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty years.", "source_path": "Judges/Judges 15.docx"}

One is that in verse 8, Barak is lacking faith - and so although Deborah agrees to go with him (v9), he won’t get the honor for the victory because of his timid lack of faith in God’s promise and command.\nRead/consider Hebrews 11:32-34. Hebrews gives faith kudos to Barak. How does this fit with Judges 4?\nBarak is actually showing faith by asking Deborah, God’s spokesperson, to go with him. He recognizes her authority and believes she can provide further guidance on the battlefield. Also he embraces the fact that in verse 9, Deborah is saying:  “On the expedition you are taking, the honor will not be yours.”  She is making a statement about his future, not giving a verdict on his faith.\nBarak’s faith:\n“What aspect of faith does Barak show in v8?”’\nHe recognizes he need God’s guidance -  listening to God\nSince Deborah is God’s representative, it’s wise for Barak to have her with him in battle\n“What aspect of faith does Barak show in v13-14?”\nHe demonstrates  courage  despite the disadvantage\nCanaanites have better technology, remember iron chariots from Ch 1\n“What aspect of faith does Barak show in v9?”\nHe knows he won’t get honor - showing  humility\nHe embraces the message that a women, not him as commander, will receive glory\nHow does Deborah’s prophecy in verse 9 come true?

Barak gives us an example of the practical aspects that come with demonstrating faith. Think about different situations in our lives.

What was good and bad about what she did?\nShe killed the main enemy of God’s people. She showed bravery and that she was on God’s side. As a Kenite, she aligned with Israel. But her actions are, by definition, sin: lying and killing. In addition, she breaks the cultural rules of hospitality (remember Abraham). In a way, it seems like she abused the hospitality culture of that time.\nHow does 5:24 describe her? What does this mean?\n“Most blessed”. Her actions were approved of in the greater narrative of God’s story. It is a testament to God’s sovereignty in utilizing everything, including sin, to carry out his purposes.\nHow do we reconcile this with Jesus’ command to love our enemies?\nLean into the tension here and allow the group to wrestle with this.

God sent rain and earthquakes (v20) - the river flooded (v21).\nHow does God’s involvement lead to  why Sisera and his army were defeated?\nRain and wet ground would be bad for chariots. Would have been unwise for Sisera to battle in those rainy conditions if he knew of them.\nWhat happens when we have only a Judges-4  “surface-level” perspective on our lives, and forget to combine it with a Judges-5 “theological” perspective?  Why is it easy to do this?\nNote: The quotations around “theological” are important. It doesn’t mean that we are somehow less theological if we don’t have a Judges-5 perspective. “Theological” is just a label to compare with “surface-level”.\nFailing to see the ‘theological’ perspective means we don’t see God's hand at work around us. We forget God’s involvement and he becomes more distant; we simply forget the supernatural exists. We end up over-honoring ourselves in success and over-despairing in struggles. Having a ‘theological’ mindset allows us to praise God for what we see him doing as well as trust him when we can’t explicitly see him moving. It allows us to trust. We easily forget this because our sinful nature makes us see what is right in front of us, including ourselves. We end up biased to honor ourselves and worship things other than God.

They are only upset at the result of their sin, the oppression.\nBefore Israel can appreciate rescue, they need to know why they need rescuing.

God equips the people he wants to use; not necessarily choosing those who are already ‘strong’ or able.\nHow does the dual truth of 1) Gideon being a mighty warrior and 2) the least of this tribe apply to Christians? What happens when we forget one “side”?\nChristians also see that we are weak but God empowers us to do his work. Our sinfulness gets in the way but God uses us to do what we could never do on our own. Christians are called to trust in God’s power and forgiveness when it comes to salvation and in our day to day.

By making the army 300, Israel should have no choice but to acknowledge God’s doing.\nRead Judges 7:8b-23\nHow does God reassure Gideon (vv. 8b-15)? How does Gideon’s response show that he has received reassurance?\nGod reassures Gideon through his word by reaffirming victory to Gideon in v9\nGod uses the word of others to reaffirm when Gideon (happens to) listen to the dream/interpretation of an  enemy  soldier\nGod also uses  circumstance in bringing Gideon to the place to hear at the exact right time\nV15- Gideon worships and confidently obeys God in response\nHow should the manner of the victory (vv. 16-23) help Gideon and Israel to trust in God, and not boast in themselves?\nThey didn’t do anything to win. They held their positions and yelled in the middle of the night, Midianites fled, and killed each other (v21-23).\nRead Judges 8:22-8:31\nGideon knows that the only king Israel should have is the Lord, not him or his son.  But how do Gideon’s actions then not match up with his words?\nV24-26 = he asks for financial reward which is something a king would do\nV27 = Gideon makes an ephod, which is worn by the high priest. The high priest is the intermediary between the people and God. This act is pointing to himself where people can meet God and find guidance from God... rather than God himself or an actual priest\nV29-31 = wives and concubines, a king’s habit. Also, Abimelech means “my father is king”\nIs Gideon a faithful character??  See what people think. Gideon seemed to be fine at first… then lost his way\nWhat do we learn from Gideon about the dangers of God-given success?\nSuccess can cause us to forget God’s grace since we want to be our own savior. God-given success can make us think we’ve earned the blessing and therefore should receive honor and glory; that we are super powerful or strong. Sometimes we can start faithful but end up absorbed in the success.\nWhat does this danger look like today for us? At work or school?\nThink about at work or school when we put so much stock in our performance. Or when we find ourselves idolizing our advancements and success. It’s easy for us to forget that God is involved in these places and in our successes at work or school. We take it as our own effort and own effort alone.\nPossible follow up …When our happiness and identity are completely wrapped up in our success, what happens?", "source_path": "Judges/Judges 7+8.docx"}

Ask the Lord of the harvest, therefore, to send out workers into his harvest field. 3 Go! I am sending you out like lambs among wolves. 4 Do not take a purse or bag or sandals; and do not greet anyone on the road. 5 “When you enter a house, first say, ‘Peace to this house.’ 6 If someone who promotes peace is there, your peace will rest on them; if not, it will return to you. 7 Stay there, eating and drinking whatever they give you, for the worker deserves his wages. Do not move around from house to house. 8 “When you enter a town and are welcomed, eat what is offered to you. 9 Heal the sick who are there and tell them, ‘The kingdom of God has come near to you.’ 10 But when you enter a town and are not welcomed, go into its streets and say, 11 ‘Even the dust of your town we wipe from our feet as a warning to you. Yet be sure of this: The kingdom of God has come near.’ 12 I tell you, it will be more bearable on that day for Sodom than for that town. 13 “Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes. 14 But it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment than for you. 15 And you, Capernaum, will you be lifted to the heavens? No, you will go down to Hades. 16 “Whoever listens to you listens to me; whoever rejects you rejects me; but whoever rejects me rejects him who sent me.” 17 The seventy-two returned with joy and said, “Lord, even the demons submit to us in your name.” 18 He replied, “I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven. 19 I have given you authority to trample on snakes and scorpions and to overcome all the power of the enemy; nothing will harm you. 20 However, do not rejoice that the spirits submit to you, but rejoice that your names are written in heaven.” 21 At that time Jesus, full of joy through the Holy Spirit, said, “I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and learned, and revealed them to little children. Yes, Father, for this is what you were pleased to do. 22 “All things have been committed to me by my Father. No one knows who the Son is except the Father, and no one knows who the Father is except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.” 23 Then he turned to his disciples and said privately, “Blessed are the eyes that see what you see. 24 For I tell you that many prophets and kings wanted to see what you see but did not see it, and to hear what you hear but did not hear it.”", "source_path": "Luke/Luke 10_1-24.docx"}

The rich man also died and was buried.  23  And being in torment in Hades, he looked up and saw Abraham a long way off, with Lazarus at his side.  24  ‘Father Abraham!’ he called out, ‘Have mercy on me and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, because I am in agony in this flame!  25  “‘Son,’ Abraham said, ‘remember that during your life you received your good things, just as Lazarus received bad things, but now he is comforted here, while you are in agony.  26  Besides all this, a great chasm has been fixed between us and you, so that those who want to pass over from here to you cannot; neither can those from there cross over to us.  27  “‘Father,’ he said, ‘then I beg you to send him to my father’s house—  28  because I have five brothers—to warn them, so that they won’t also come to this place of torment.  29  “But Abraham said, ‘They have Moses and the prophets; they should listen to them.’  30  “‘No, father Abraham,’ he said. ‘But if someone from the dead goes to them, they will repent.’  31  “But he told him, ‘If they don’t listen to Moses and the prophets, they will not be persuaded if someone rises from the dead.’”\nIce Breaker: When have you alerted someone of a potential danger? (It can be really minor, like a wet floor)\nContext:\nParable of the Dishonest Manager and Pharisees’ reaction to it\nRich man- purple, linen\nCeremonial uncleanliness- poor man was covered with sores, licked by dogs\nThis is a different Lazarus from the one Jesus rose from the dead\nJews didn’t have a concept of “heaven” like we do, their vision of desired afterlife was to be reunited with their great ancestors like Abraham, Jacob, Moses, etc.\nQuestions:\nHow does the rich man use his money while he’s alive?\nBuys and dresses in the nicest clothes\nBuys and eats the nicest food\nGenerally spends all his resources on himself\nWhat do the rich man’s actions in the afterlife reveal about how he views Lazarus? What about when both were alive?\nAsks Abraham to command Lazarus to help him instead of asking Lazarus directly\nRecognizes Lazarus by name, suggesting that the rich man was familiar with who he was\nGenerally shows how the rich man looks down on Lazarus in the afterlife, and likely did while they were both alive\nWhy did the rich man end up where he is after death? What needed to change for his fate to be different?\nWhile alive, the rich man was familiar with who Lazarus was and his situation, but never bothered to help him even with the leftovers he had\nThe issue was not about how much or little he helped, but rather  why  the rich man didn’t help Lazarus\nThe rich man was only interested in doing things and spending his resources in ways that would bring benefit or satisfaction back to himself\nThe rich man lacked a compassionate heart, which is why he was never interested in helping Lazarus\nWhat needed to change was the entirety of the rich man’s heart and priorities, not just his interactions with Lazarus\nWhy does the rich man want to warn his brothers? How does Abraham respond to his request?\nRich man realizes that it’s too late for him to be with Abraham anymore, but still hopes his brothers still have the chance\nRich man thinks that if his brothers see Lazarus resurrected that would help them reach a different fate after death\nAbraham tells the rich man that even seeing someone come back from the dead wouldn’t be enough to change the fate of his brothers\nThe rich man believes that if his brothers act somewhat differently in life that it would lead to them having a different experience after death\nAbraham explains that the issue with the rich man’s brothers is with their hearts, just like the rich man himself\nWhat does Christian compassion look like? Why is it important?\nChristian compassion looks like caring for someone  even/especially when it’s not convenient to do so\nOnly serving others when it’s easy or doesn’t come at a cost to ourselves isn’t really compassion, but instead convenience\nGood example is parable of the Good Samaritan\nTrue compassion is also the mark of a heart changed by the Gospel\nWhile having compassion doesn’t earn righteousness or salvation, it’s a measuring point for how much your heart is changed by God\nHow have you personally seen an example of this kind of compassion in your life?\nCARE GROUP\nWhere’s an area of your life that you see an opportunity to show more of this kind of compassion?

The crooked roads shall become straight,     the rough ways smooth.\n6  And all people will see God’s salvation.’” [ a ]\n7  John said to the crowds coming out to be baptized by him, “You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath? 8  Produce fruit in keeping with repentance. And do not begin to say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our father.’ For I tell you that out of these stones God can raise up children for Abraham.  9  The ax is already at the root of the trees, and every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.”\n10  “What should we do then?” the crowd asked.\n11  John answered, “Anyone who has two shirts should share with the one who has none, and anyone who has food should do the same.”\n12  Even tax collectors came to be baptized.“Teacher,” they asked, “what should we do?”\n13  “Don’t collect any more than you are required to,” he told them.\n14  Then some soldiers asked him, “And what should we do?”\nHe replied, “Don’t extort money and don’t accuse people falsely—be content with your pay.”\n15  The people were waiting expectantly and were all wondering in their hearts if John might possibly be the Messiah.  16  John answered them all, “I baptize you with [ b ] water. But one who is more powerful than I will come, the straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie. He will baptize you with [ c ]  the Holy Spirit and fire.  17  His winnowing fork is in his hand to clear his threshing floor and to gather the wheat into his barn, but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.”  18  And with many other words John exhorted the people and proclaimed the good news to them.\n19  But when John rebuked Herod the tetrarch because of his marriage to Herodias, his brother’s wife, and all the other evil things he had done,  20  Herod added this to them all: He locked John up in prison.\nThe Baptism and Genealogy of Jesus\n21  When all the people were being baptized, Jesus was baptized too.

Was this normal? Why stand up to read?\nIV Answer: The tradition in the synagogues of Jesus’ day was not to have a regular minister/preacher for each synagogue, but rather to have the Scripture read and discussed. Often a distinguished visitor was asked to read the Scripture and comment on it.\nIn order to appreciate what happens here, one must understand the synagogue service order. Our knowledge of such a service comes from ancient Jewish sources such as the Misb-nab, the Jewish codification of their oral law.\n10 men must be present. Recite the Shemah from Dueterotomy, share prayers such as the tephillah. Then a reading from the Torah, and from the prophets. Then an exposition to tie it together, and ends with a benediction.

Ready to throw him off a cliff.\nThey praised him and are impressed by him and his teachings, but didn’t necessarily believe him. Which is still somewhat true today.  TGC Answer:\n(1) Jesus does not cite the entirety of Isaiah 61:2, omitting a reference to coming judgment;\n(2) Jesus cites Isaiah 58:6 instead, claiming authority not only to announce but also to accomplish salvation; and\n(3) he refers to Elijah and Elisha (Luke 4:24–27), who ministered during a time of large-scale rebellion by Israel against God\nIV Ans: In verses 25-27, Jesus is referring to two Old Testament stories (1 Kings 17:1-24 and 2 Kings 5:1-14) that would be familiar to the people then but are not so familiar to us. Look closely at the two people who receive ministry: the widow at Zarephath in Sidon in verse 26, and Naaman the Syrian leper in verse 27. What do they have in common? (They were both Gentiles.)

Ready to throw him off a cliff.\nHow did he walk right through the crowd?\nIs Jesus’ sermon concerned with redeeming people from physical bondage or from spiritual bondage?\nIV:  Why do you think Luke put such an emphasis on Jesus’ reading of this Scripture in Isaiah?\nWhat do you think the “year of the Lord’s favor” is that Jesus is going to proclaim?\nIV Ans: Verse 19 is a quote from Isaiah but also alludes to Leviticus 25:10, which describes the Year of Jubilee, an every-50-year festival of freedom, worship, and economic justice.\nIV: Looking again at verses 18-19 as a whole, how is Jesus defining his mission?

What are they implying with this line of questioning?\nEating and drinking (AKA not fasting)\nThe Pharisees are implying that Jesus’ disciples are too happy. When fasting, the Pharisees would make a big show of how hungry & unhappy they are, in order to appear more pious through suffering.\nJesus tells the Pharisees a parable about taking new things and using it to patch up older things (garment, wineskins). How does this relate to their accusation?\nBeing the Son of God, Jesus is introducing the Pharisees to a new way to live in harmony with God. They are trying to take his teachings/way of life and apply it to the old laws. Since Jesus has come to fulfill the old laws and brings grace to his followers, the two are not able to be combined.\nAdditionally, those who have a taste of the new, will no longer desire the old\nNew vs Old. What is the new? What is the old?\nHave you tried to use something “new” to repair something “old”? How did it go?\nDoes NOT have to be spiritual – this is hopefully a more lighthearted way to apply Jesus’ parable in a way that people can relate to individually.\nRead 6:1-5\nHere we read of another accusation by the Pharisees. What are they accusing Jesus’ disciples of this time?\n“Working” on the Sabbath (what they did can be seen as reaping, threshing, winnowing, and preparing food. Four laws violated in one action.)\nWhy does Jesus quote scripture to them? Why did Jesus bring up the story of David? What is Jesus implying by calling himself “...lord of the Sabbath?”\nHe was subtly rebuking them for not knowing scripture. Specifically, the  meaning  behind scripture\nJesus is telling the Pharisees that the grace and human need is more important than religious ritual for the sake of it. Extending love and grace to others is of higher importance.\nAs lord of the Sabbath, who are the Pharisees to be offended on His behalf? If he was not offended, they are not to be offended FOR him.\nAlso was a direct claim to being God. He claims to have authority to know whether or not his disciple have broken the sabbath law – for it is his law.\nWhere are areas in your life where you hold more value in “following the rules” than extending grace to others? Do you give yourself grace in these areas more than you give to others? Why?\nAllow answers that aren’t necessarily spiritually related. Be prepared to answer first to encourage others and provide an example. If we can approach it spiritually, great! If not, the call to action from a spiritual viewpoint will be covered during the regroup.\nPre Context: Wedding party lengths (a week)\nHow often fasts lasted and what frequency\nFasts in old testament\nWineskin info\nReason for fasts & how the pharisees made their fasting known\nPost context:\nexplanation of David eating the holy bread\nWhy putting new into old doesn’t work – how Jesus came to present a new way of communicating with God\nCall to action: Evaluate where in your life you are “putting new into old”.

They tried to bring him in and set him down before him.  19  Since they could not find a way to bring him in because of the crowd, they went up on the roof and lowered him on the stretcher through the roof tiles into the middle of the crowd before Jesus.  20  Seeing their faith he said, “Friend, your sins are forgiven.”  21  Then the scribes and the Pharisees began to think to themselves, “Who is this man who speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins but God alone?”  22  But perceiving their thoughts, Jesus replied to them, “Why are you thinking this in your hearts?  23  Which is easier: to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Get up and walk’?  24  But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins”—he told the paralyzed man, “I tell you: Get up, take your stretcher, and go home.”  25  Immediately he got up before them, picked up what he had been lying on, and went home glorifying God.  26  Then everyone was astounded, and they were giving glory to God.

You did not give me any water for my feet, but she wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair. 45 You did not give me a kiss, but this woman, from the time I entered, has not stopped kissing my feet. 46 You did not put oil on my head, but she has poured perfume on my feet. 47 Therefore, I tell you, her many sins have been forgiven—as her great love has shown. But whoever has been forgiven little loves little.” 48 Then Jesus said to her, “Your sins are forgiven.” 49 The other guests began to say among themselves, “Who is this who even forgives sins?” 50 Jesus said to the woman, “Your faith has saved you; go in peace.”\nThe Parable of the Sower (Ch 8)\nAfter this, Jesus traveled about from one town and village to another, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom of God.

So they ceased, and there was a calm.  25  He said to them, “Where is your faith?” They were fearful and amazed, asking one another, “Who then is this? He commands even the winds and the waves, and they obey him!”  26  Then they sailed to the region of the Gerasenes, which is opposite Galilee.  27  When he got out on land, a demon-possessed man from the town met him. For a long time he had worn no clothes and did not stay in a house but in the tombs.  28  When he saw Jesus, he cried out, fell down before him, and said in a loud voice, “What do you have to do with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg you, don’t torment me!”  29  For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. Many times it had seized him, and though he was guarded, bound by chains and shackles, he would snap the restraints and be driven by the demon into deserted places.  30  “What is your name?” Jesus asked him. “Legion,” he said, because many demons had entered him.  31  And they begged him not to banish them to the abyss.  32  A large herd of pigs was there, feeding on the hillside. The demons begged him to permit them to enter the pigs, and he gave them permission.  33  The demons came out of the man and entered the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and drowned.  34  When the men who tended them saw what had happened, they ran off and reported it in the town and in the countryside.  35  Then people went out to see what had happened. They came to Jesus and found the man the demons had departed from, sitting at Jesus’s feet, dressed and in his right mind. And they were afraid.  36  Meanwhile, the eyewitnesses reported to them how the demon-possessed man was delivered.  37  Then all the people of the Gerasene region asked him to leave them, because they were gripped by great fear. So getting into the boat, he returned.  38  The man from whom the demons had departed begged him earnestly to be with him.

What does each interaction reveal about what true discipleship to Jesus looks like?\nFirst individual (57-58), assumes he is simply following a rabbi similar to their time. Jesus is warning that he is much greater and does not have a place in the world. His expectation is not correct.\nIs a general warning of the conditions and lifestyle a true disciple of Jesus will have - one that lacks comfort and because is focused on an end result not on Earth, will leave those practicing it feeling out of place in the world\nSecond individual (59-60), more focused on family matters than Jesus. The role of discipleship takes priority over family related manners.\nThe practice of burying relatives, especially direct family, was one held with some of the highest importance in Jewish/general culture in Jesus’ time.\nJesus’ response demonstrates that true discipleship should hold even greater importance than one’s most sacred/significant family and cultural practices\nThird individual (61-62), more focused on his past. Those that look back cannot engage in discipleship. The new has replaced the old.\nThe purpose of discipleship is to transform us into people who are more like Jesus and therefore more like God, preparing for us life beyond Earth.\nHolding too much attention to things and matters that are related to our time on Earth can be a distraction/deterrent from this process of transformation\nWhat internal obstacles/costs prevent you from putting your personal discipleship to Jesus as the highest priority in your life?\nDiscipleship should be a highest priority in our life\nFeel free to share any personal obstacles that might stand in the way.\nWhy is discipleship/following Jesus something we should even care about or focus on? What makes it so important? (maybe optional)\nChallenge any responses that are along the lines of “because the Bible says it’s important”\nWant to be able to draw some personal meaning behind deciding to follow Jesus, not just because someone/something else desired it for us\nEssentially, why do  you  want to devote yourself to following Jesus?", "source_path": "Luke/Luke 9_51-62.docx"}

Maybe ask if people’s answers have changed since before?\nWhy is it important to identify these things?\nThe rest of the questions are to help dig further and critically think about how we handle and see emotions. It’s important to identify so we are more aware of how we feel and why we feel a certain way. From there, we can better engage with how our feelings relate to other people as well as how they help us communicate with God. God made us emotional beings. Emotions are not supposed to be ignored or viewed as something secondary.\nWhat has influenced the way I approach the above emotions?\nTangentially related to the session on family. Hopefully people are willing to look backwards for a little bit. Family will probably be the biggest player for this question. But perhaps there were events growing up that affected how we interact with our own emotions. Proper follow-up questions will be important here.\nWhy is it difficult for me to talk about emotions?\nIf you still have time, this is the cherry on top.

Why is Paul so joyful?\nPaul is regularly thinking about them; he sees them as partners. He thanks them for their support during his time in prison and otherwise. He yearns for them (could ask what that means). He desires for them to grow in love and for them to grow in Christ. Paul is joyful because he loves them. He has this joy that comes with partnering with this church and hearing about their growth.\nWhat do you notice about Paul’s prayer life?\nHas a vertical component of thanking God, but there is intentional praying for others, the Philippians. He isn’t just praying for them because there is a desperate need, but just regularly remembering them. He’s also praying for their growth; he seems highly invested in them even though he’s not physically with them.\nWhat do our prayers usually look like?\nPossible subtopics: content, affect, wording, frequency, posture.\nWhy do we pray in the first place?\nNot just asking for stuff, but aligning ourselves with God. It’s part of communicating in this relationship with God. Prayer itself is acknowledging our weakness and need for God; hopefully, not just when we are in desperate need. Sometimes we pray because we feel like it’s the ‘right’ thing to do.\nHow can we foster this kind of joy in praying to God and regularly praying for one another?\nI can imagine discussion going into what to do when we don’t feel like praying which goes into the discipline of it. There is a practice that we need to establish. We cannot simply wait for us to WANT to or FEEL like it or else it’ll never happen. We can ask for this joy. But the development of joy won’t be the first step for the majority of people. Accountability helps, getting reminders to spend time in prayer.

Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed, and in that I rejoice.\nYes, and I will rejoice,  19  for I know that through your prayers and the help of the Spirit of Jesus Christ this will turn out for my deliverance,  20  as it is my eager expectation and hope that I will not be at all ashamed, but that with full courage now as always Christ will be honored in my body, whether by life or by death.  21  For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.  22  If I am to live in the flesh, that means fruitful labor for me. Yet which I shall choose I cannot tell.  23  I am hard pressed between the two. My desire is to depart and be with Christ, for that is far better.  24  But to remain in the flesh is more necessary on your account.  25  Convinced of this, I know that I will remain and continue with you all, for your progress and joy in the faith,  26  so that in me you may have ample cause to glory in Christ Jesus, because of my coming to you again.\nPaul going to prison leads to…\nGuard and other knowing he’s there for Christ (v13)\nPeople more bold to speak out of love (v14,16)\nPeople more bold to speak to afflict Paul (v17) [how?]\nPaul’s attitude - circumstance isn’t excuse for behavior (being in prison)\nBe with Christ vs be with people\nTreasuring Christ above all?\nHorizontal and vertical again?

How is Paul feeling in this situation?\nGeneral observation question; we can just ask what people observe. Paul is in prison but Paul isn’t despairing. Paul seems joyful and motivated at the same time especially when it comes to acknowledging his role in prison as a part of God’s work. We can also consider how we would feel if we were in prison.\nHow does Paul’s response to the situation affect others?\nGuard and other knowing he’s there for Christ (v13). People more bold to speak out of love (v14,16). People more bold to speak to afflict Paul (v17)\nHow can Paul respond this way despite his circumstance?\nV19 tells us the prayers of others plus the spirit of Jesus. Paul is able to see that even his imprisonment is for greater purpose. He is prioritizing the gospel even above his own wellbeing; this is also through understanding that Jesus also went through suffering. This spirit of Christ sympathizes with him and helps him persevere. It all leads to him being willing to honor Christ in life or death.\nHow would people describe us when we are going through tough circumstances? What’s typically our focus when we go through tough circumstances?\nExamples are always nice. Being frank about our lack-of joy is also nice. Too often we get fixated and overwhelmed by hard circumstances which is normal and we don’t want to guilt people of that. We want to point people to Christ in the midst of those circumstances. Other people might have had just an easy life with no tough circumstances.\nWhat does v21 mean for Paul? What are the implications of this verse for us today?\nThis verse is Paul’s expression of his love and desire for Christ. He understands that his aim is to honor Christ as much as possible while he is on earth; he wants to labor for Jesus since Jesus is worthy. At the same time, he knows that dying means he can be with Christ forever. He actually believes in that hope and reality with no more burdens of earthly life. This verse challenges us in our attitudes today. Where is our ultimate desire? Do we want to align with what Paul is saying? If so, our priorities and outlook on life should change. Not that we drop everything and become missionaries/pastors, but we would be more conscious of what God wants to do through our work, school, relationships, etc. It also helps put our earthly experiences in perspective; we can hope in a bright future with Christ even when things don’t work out on earth according to our plan/preference.", "source_path": "Philippians/Philippians 1_12-26.docx"}

Group members will probably go more concrete. Don’t be afraid to point out things that we all experience in normal life that don’t quite line up with the gospel.\nWhy does Paul want the Philippians to live gospel-worthy lives?\nMostly a comprehension question. He wants them to be unified and work together for the gospel. He also wants them to be able to stand firm against enemies. These are straight from the passage.\nHow does unity help the gospel witness?\nIn a world with lots of disunity, unity can stand out as a witness. Unity also enables us to support one another in living for the gospel, especially when going through suffering. The mutual support helps us to persevere in living for the gospel; perseverance then becomes a testimony to the world. Might be worth asking what Christian unity looks like…\nHow could suffering cause disunity? Think about the typical responses to suffering.\nWe want to point out how selfish suffering leads to bigger issues. When we are zeroed in on solving our own problems and not walking with others towards unity, it will naturally lead to disunity. Selfish suffering promotes isolation and not genuine relationships. The solution is not to avoid suffering; suffering is an inevitable part of life. We want to focus on our response to it.\nWhat are some reasons why we don’t want to suffer? How do we reconcile this with what the Bible says about suffering?\nMaybe point out that v29 makes suffering an inevitable thing as Christians.

How often does serving others come to mind?\nWe want to highlight how we are very inward/self focused, especially with our time. This passage is primarily talking about relationships between Christians. We already find it difficult sacrificing for brothers and sisters even during a normal work week. If there are any issues or difficulties in life, serving is even further out of our minds.\nWhat do we learn about Christ’s nature from these verses? How is understanding Christ’s nature significant to his example of humility?\nWe see how he is God, completely equal. This is important since it makes his humility even more impactful. He really, really lowers himself to dwell with humanity and die for humanity.\nWhy is Christ’s humility so important for us?\nFirstly, his humility is why salvation is possible. Christ stoops so low for people like us, for some reason. It means that somehow, we are valuable enough to Jesus to stoop low. Meaning each person also has this value for us to serve them as well. It also is our example and source in being humble. We see how, even for us, there is future exaltation that comes with humility.\nCare Groups\nWhat makes it hard for me to take “the form of a servant”?\nWhere or with whom does God want me to exercise humility?

What phrase or verse do you find most difficult?\nWarm up question. Just getting people to start thinking a little more personally about the passage.\nWhat does it look like to obey and work out our salvation? What does it look like to not obey?\nThe second question might be easier to answer. There is a degree of discipline when looking to obey; we do not naturally follow God. It is an active movement and intentional choice to do so. A passive approach most likely does not lead to obedience.\nWhat makes it hard to obey? What does it mean to ‘grumble’ and ‘dispute’?\nIt often calls for us to deny what we want to do. It moves us out of our default or comfort zone. It can also be inconvenient. Might be good to tie this into question 2 with specific examples. When people answer, they’ll have some sort of specific in mind. “Grumbling” and “disputing” deals with our attitude towards obedience. When we are consistently sour towards God and serving others, grumbling and disputing follow. Disputing - not negating questioning but picking fights for selfish reasons.\nWhat is our current motivation for obedience?\nLove? Fear? Fear of whom? Fear of God and Hell? Fear of pastors and leaders? Duty? Just because? Mom and dad said so? Is it the status quo? ‘Right thing’ to do?\nHow do we move to a “correct” motivation? - love AND fear\nMaybe ask what the ‘correct’ motivation is. Like we discussed, “proper” love includes a healthy fear and understanding of God. “Proper” fear embraces his love. But in the real world, we don’t have a perfect embrace of these things. These things require prayer because we cannot manifest these motivations. But we cannot simply wait for this to happen before obedience. This is all part of the ‘working out’ process.\n1.  In the last section, Paul talked about Christ’s “obedience” (2:8). Paul now calls us to be obedient. Think about how Christ was obedient and think about the issues that Paul has been dealing with so far in Philippians. Summarize what Paul might have in mind when he tells us to “obey”.\nChrist was obedient by humbling himself to serve others, even to the point of dying on the cross for them. Paul is calling us to live lives worthy of the gospel, to suffer gladly for the advancement of the gospel, to unite as a community for the sake of the gospel, and serve one another so that all persevere in their faith and ministry.\n2.  Paul insists that they should “obey”, or “work out your salvation”, not only in Paul’s presence but much more in his absence. Why did Paul have to insist on their obedience in his absence? Why might a group of people be more prone to disobedience when their leadership is away?\nIf people think Paul is never coming back they may be tempted to vie for power and influence, or they may leave off faithfulness to the gospel ministry knowing that they are not being held accountable. On the other hand, the lack of Paul’s ministry, encouragement, prayers, and service to the Philippians might be felt as a big hole in the spiritual input they had been receiving.\n3.  Paul says that God is at work in the Philippians. How would an understanding of this reality motivate or empower the Philippians to obey even in the absence of their leadership?\nEven if Paul is not there to hold the Philippians accountable, people ought to fear that God is still among them and conduct themselves accordingly. Additionally, just because the Philippians do not have Paul ministering to them, they still have God, which is far better. People can expect God to continue working in them to bring to completion what he started with or without Paul (1:6).\n4.  What is it about grumbling and questioning, that makes it impossible for a person to be “blameless and innocent”, even when they are doing “all things” they have been asked to do? Why is it so important to Paul that our attitudes match our actions?\nGod does not call us to outward behavior only but wants our hearts to be engaged in the manners of his kingdom. When our hearts are sour toward the things of God it comes through in our speech, even if we are “obeying” in our actions.\n5.  In verse 2:14­15 Paul is reflecting on Deuteronomy 32:5. In what ways were the Israelites prevented from being “lights in the world” because of their grumbling and questioning? How might “obedient” Christians similarly be prevented from being “lights in the world” by their bad attitudes?\nIt would have been obvious to the nations that the Israelites often doubted God by their grumbling against him. If he was the God of the Israelites and they doubted him, how could anyone else trust him? If we grumble, we betray to the world around us that we are not willing to trust God, or that he is not enough to satisfy us, or that he is not powerful or caring enough to deal with the issues that are important to us.", "source_path": "Philippians/Philippians 2_12-18.docx"}

Paul tells the Philippians that Timothy is uniquely qualified for certain important tasks. Paul tells the Philippians to honor Epaphroditus. What caused Paul to esteem these men? What about your life would cause those in your life to conclude your concern for Jesus and others was genuine? In what ways are you “proving your worth”?\nThey were genuine in their concern for the church and the lost, and the priorities of Christ had become their priorities. Paul had seen a track record of faithfulness and was willing to entrust them with significant responsibility.\n8.   What does it look like to rejoice in the Lord? Evaluate these statements: 1. Joy in the Lord and grumbling are incompatible. 2. Joy in the Lord and sorrow are incompatible. 3. Joy in the Lord and suffering are incompatible.\nJoy in the Lord and grumbling are in­compatible since all grumbling is ultimately against our Lord as the sovereign ruler of all things. Joy and sorrow are compatible since you can be joyful in the Lord and sorrowful about other things at the same time. Joy in the Lord is our comfort in suffering.\nHow does Paul describe Timothy?\nGenuinely concerned for the Philippians’ welfare\nSeek Jesus’ interest over own interest\n“Worthy” in the eyes of the Philippians\nCo-laborer\nHow does Paul describe Epaphroditus?\nBrother, fellow worker, soldier\nSent by Philippians\nRisking life for work of Christ\nWhat does it mean for Timothy to have “proven worth”? Are we “reliable/trustworthy”?\nTimothy has shown to be faithful to work side-by-side with Paul (like a son to a father). Not an “earning” type of thing, but more on a human to human level when it comes to serving. Perhaps looking at why we are NOT reliable/trustworthy would be helpful. Just because we are Christian, does not mean we automatically become good servants. It takes effort and struggle and learning.\nWhat does it look like to seek Jesus’ interests over our own?\nWe can look at if we even consider what Jesus wants in our decision making. It means we are willing to give up more and more parts of our lives for Jesus; the number of idols decrease as we grow. This is a conscious effort to think about and move towards Jesus’ interests.

What does this look like for us today?\nIn the Jewish man’s eyes, Paul would be the ultimate Jew. Super righteous according to the law, so he should be confident in his righteous status. Paul sees it as nothing compared to the gospel of Jesus. For us, these are things that we are proud of or things that are “good enough”, especially spiritually speaking. (going to church, tithing, attending bible study/sunday school). A good way to diagnose this is seeing if/how we compare ourselves with others. (I’m not like that guy who doesn’t show up to fellowship/church, I’m an ‘average’ church person so that’s fine). That’s how we justify our spiritual behavior and have ‘confidence in the flesh’.\nWhat does Paul mean in v7-8? How have we experienced this now or in the past? What are potential things that we currently do not count as loss?\nEverything else is nothing compared to Christ. Everything is trash compared to the worth of Jesus; this everything is literally everything. We want to ask people how certain things have gotten “smaller” in life or how Christ has gotten “bigger”.

Paul says to imitate him. 2. Keep your eyes on those who walk like Paul. 3. Stand firm in the Lord\nWhat are the differences between the enemies of the cross and those who walk like Paul?\n(1) Christians are heavenly oriented others earthly, (2) Christians anticipate that the glory of Christ will be their own, others glory in their own lowly and shameful reality because they can imagine no better, (3) Christians are subject only to him who subjects all things to himself, even for the good of his people, others are slaves to their bellies having no power to oppose the gods of their various passions, (4) Christians are awaiting salvation, others will end in destruction.\nWhat does it look like to have our minds set on heavenly things?\nIt doesn’t mean that we are consciously always doing church activities. It means that we align with God in what he wants in our lives. We care about the things he cares about, which is not restricted to “Christian” things.\nIn our day to day, when do we find ourselves set on earthly things? How do we move towards a more heavenward mindset?\nOftentimes we are just thinking about the things in front of us, which is not necessarily a bad thing. The normal things in our lives need attention. We need to consider how God interacts with our day to day (work, school, home, etc). In discussion, explore what people think about heavenly/earthly thinking. Is there a lot of compartmentalizing? Is God in places outside of fellowship and church? It might be worth exploring how we identify heavenly/earthly thinking. Possible areas to talk about are what things do we feel like we cannot live without, what things do we think will ultimate satisfy us (like we’ve ‘made it’), do we approach things in our lives thinking what God wants…\nDesire, what do I want to see/do?\nWhat, if gone, feels like the end of the world\nContentment vs striving (in what areas)\nWhat questions are we asking about different areas of life?

What does this look like? How do we not stand firm?\n2.  Put in your own words what Paul’s main concern for the Philippians might be.\nPaul has watched a number of men become enemies of the cross as they tried to fill their bellies on earthly things. He wants his beloved Philippians to stay true to Christ.\n3.  Paul draws a number of contrasts between those who walk as enemies of the cross (19) and those who walk like Paul (20). Let’s discuss them. What is one way Paul describes those who are enemies of the cross? How is that contrasted with believers?\nThere is a fourfold contrast between Christians and non-Christians: (1) Christians are heavenly oriented others earthly, (2) Christians anticipate that the glory of Christ will be their own, others glory in their own lowly and shameful reality because they can imagine no better, (3) Christians are subject only to him who subjects all things to himself, even for the good of his people, others are slaves to their bellies having no power to oppose the gods of their various passions, (4) Christians are awaiting salvation, others will end in destruction.\n4.  Why do you think some are able to stand firm and others flirt with worldly ways of living? What perspectives does Paul offer to help the believer stand firm?\nThey are citizens of heaven, their Savior is coming. If they really believe that they are citizens of heaven they will be less likely to flirt with earthly things. If they really trust Jesus is coming for them, they will be unwilling to abandon their faith even if it causes them momentary discomfort.\n5.  Paul says about the enemies of the cross of Christ that they have their minds “set on earthly things”. Obviously we all have to think about getting an education, earning a living, finding a spouse, taking care of our possessions. What is the difference between having a mind “set” on these things versus just thinking about them to be responsible?\nWe have to think about the affairs of this world, but they must never become our driving motivation, our hunger, or our passions. We should be slaves only to the will of God and we deal with the issues of this world as part of serving him, bringing him glory, seeking our satisfaction in him.\n6.  Some people accuse Christians of being so “heavenly minded” that they are useless and negligent in the issues that the world faces. Is Paul’s insistence that we be heavenly minded a help or hindrance to our ability to do good in this world? Debate.\n7.  We often talk about ourselves as being “saved,” i.e. past tense. What aspects of our salvation are still pending, according to this passage or others? Why is it important to always remember that our salvation is not fully accomplished? How might forgetting this contribute to someone not persevering in their walk with Christ?\nWe are still not delivered from the sin in our flesh, we are not immortal, we are still subject to the curse upon the earth, we are still cut off from face to face intimacy with the Lord, we are persecuted for righteousness. It is important to remember that our salvation is not complete so that we do not become discouraged as if this was all God had for us. If we believed we were supposed to fully experience salvation now, we would soon become discouraged that our experience is far short of what we imagined it would be. We will experience full salvation, but we look forward to that day in hope and do not become discouraged when we experience the difficulties of this life.", "source_path": "Philippians/Philippians 3_17-4_1.docx"}

For his sake I have suffered the loss of all things and count them as rubbish, in order that I may gain Christ  9  and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which comes through faith in Christ, the righteousness from God that depends on faith—  10  that I may know him and the power of his resurrection, and may share his my sufferings, becoming like him in his death,  11  that by any means possible I may attain the resurrection from the dead.\n12  Not that I have already obtained this or am already perfect, but I press on to make it my own, because Christ Jesus has made me his own.  13  Brothers, I do not consider that I have made it my own. But one thing I do: forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead,  14  I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.  15  Let those of us who are mature think this way, and if in anything you think otherwise, God will reveal that also to you.  16  Only let us hold true to what we have attained.\nWhy is the resurrection important for Christians? What does Paul mean in v10-11?\nResurrection is the basis for hope and new life; we follow Jesus’ pattern after this life. Without resurrection, we are just like everyone else in death. It is Christ’s resurrection that saves us and allows us to know his power. This ‘knowing’ is ultimately experienced in suffering. Paul really desires to know Jesus and his power at all cost.\nHow does the resurrection relate to the v12-16?\nResurrection is basically a finish line that we are moving towards. It is a hope for us in the future. If we have this goal in mind, it influences how we live in the present. This is part of us realizing that spiritual things are important in the present. These verse are part of the “how” for attaining the resurrection.\nHow do you feel when reading v13-14? What does it look like for us?\nDo we find it encouraging? Burdensome? Impossible? Tired? This is one of the verses that we’ve become numb to because we hear it so much. We want to take an honest, fresh look at it and how we respond. It means that we take an active role in our growth; it means we realize our need to depend on God for this growth. It means that we repent of past sins and do not let past failures control us.\nWhat struggles do you face when encouraged to “press on”?...What hope do we have?\nFeeling like we’re at our limit, feeling like we’re not good enough, patterns of failure, feeling lazy to try.\nHow would we describe resurrection in the Christian life?

How does it make us feel?\nIs it burdensome? Impossible? Encouraging?\n1.   What does it mean to be “found in” Christ? How is this related to being righteous?\nTo be found in Christ is a spatial metaphor that describes God finding us inside Jesus. Because we are inside Jesus, when God finds us, he only finds the merits of Christ’s righteousness and not our own. Therefore to be in Christ is to possess his righteousness.\n2.  Paul says the ultimate purpose of being righteous is so that he can know Christ and the power of his  resurrection . What does he mean by these things?\nKnowing Christ is having a relationship with him. The power of his resurrection is to experience the life-giving power that rose Christ from the dead. This resurrection power is currently at work in our souls. It initially gave us new life when we were born again at the beginning of our faith in Christ. It continues to be at work in every believer giving them life, transforming them to be more like Christ. When God works in us to will and to work for his good pleasure it is this resurrection power that he uses.\n3.  What is the resurrection of the dead?\nThis phrase is describing something different from the power of Christ’s resurrection. Here Paul has in mind the actual resurrection of the dead at the Day of Christ. This final resurrection is the beginning of the full experience of eternal life.\nExplore – Read 3:12-16 [The Joyful Perseverance That Comes From Assurance]\n4.   Some people argue that if you are assured eternal life there is no more motivation to persevere in a life of serving Christ. Yet here Paul indicates that his motivation to persevere is just because “Christ Jesus has made me his own”. How does this work? Why might the assurance that Paul belongs to Christ motivate him to “strain forward” toward heaven?\nWhen we are assured of our place with Christ, we have every motivation to persevere for him until we get there. Imagine if you were only 50/50 you would go to heaven to be with Christ. If you encountered suffering for Christ in this life, you could easily conclude that it is not worth it to continue being faithful to Christ when, after all, you don’t know for sure if it will be worth it in the end. However, if you know Christ has made you his own, and you are 100% sure of your relationship with him, then you know that no matter what suffering you experience in this life for Christ it will be worth it, in the end, to be faithful and persevere, because Christ has guaranteed that the prize for your suffering will be waiting for you.\n5.  Why might Paul consider it a mark of maturity to recognize your own imperfection?\nWe are all imperfect, so anyone who is not willing to recognize that they have not achieved perfection is blind to his own condition. Mature people have a clear sense of their imperfection along with an indefatigable drive to be more Christ-like. This drive comes from God’s power at work in their lives and the joy of knowing Christ. The mature experience God’s power and joy in the Lord, not because they are more righteous, but because they put their confidence in Christ and not in themselves.", "source_path": "Philippians/Philippians 3_8-16.docx"}

You were indeed concerned for me, but you had no opportunity.  11  Not that I am speaking of being in need, for I have learned in whatever situation I am to be content.  12  I know how to be brought low, and I know how to abound. In any and every circumstance, I have learned the secret of facing plenty and hunger, abundance and need.  13  I can do all things through him who strengthens me.\n14  Yet it was kind of you to share my trouble.  15  And you Philippians yourselves know that in the beginning of the gospel, when I left Macedonia, no church entered into partnership with me in giving and receiving, except you only.  16  Even in Thessalonica you sent me help for my needs once and again.  17  Not that I seek the gift, but I seek the fruit that increases to your credit.  18  I have received full payment, and more. I am well supplied, having received from Epaphroditus the gifts you sent, a fragrant offering, a sacrifice acceptable and pleasing to God.  19  And my God will supply every need of yours according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus.  20  To our God and Father be glory forever and ever. Amen.\n21  Greet every saint in Christ Jesus. The brothers who are with me greet you.  22  All the saints greet you, especially those of Caesar's household.\n23  The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.\nIcebreaker!\nWhat is Paul able to do according to v12-13?\nPaul has been through a lot and is able to be content in all of it. He is able to live and thrive under any situation. “All things” is not relating to everything/anything in this verse. Paul acknowledges that it is Christ who enables him to be content in all circumstances.\nWhat does it look like for us to be content in 2022?\nSee what the ‘minimum’ is for different people. They will have different ideas of what is “enough” to be content. Possible follow up question is whether having ‘stuff’ or pursuing ‘stuff’ is a bad thing. Being content requires us to put “stuff” in its correct place in our minds. When we feel like we continuously need more, we will not be content. Like Paul, it is Christ who aids us to be content. Our ultimate goal shifts from “stuff” to things that are lasting.\nLooking at v14-20, how would you describe their relationship? What did the Philippians do for Paul?\nWe’ve seen in earlier chapters how close Paul was to the Philippian church. This passage supports that idea. Paul wanted to see the church blessed and thriving and have their spiritual “credit increase.” They were  continuous  supporters of Paul; more so than other churches. They sent money to Paul through Epaphroditus. The Philippian church was a close partner of Paul.\nHow are we supposed to view finances and “stuff” as Christians?\nWe’re not supposed to be monks who rid ourselves of earthly things. At the same time, we’re not supposed to make money and ‘stuff’ the ultimate in our lives. We need to understand that these things are from God and ultimately belong to him. If he is Lord over all, then he is Lord over our stuff. I’m sure people will be able to give the “correct” answer here. So follow up questions can deal with our personal experience with money and stuff. How have we fallen into the trap of overvaluing money? What are certain areas that are pitfalls for us? How should we use our money in a God-honoring way?\nWhat makes it hard for us to give and be generous? What are ways we can practice this?\nWe want to share about the normal challenges that comes with giving. Perhaps people can share experiences especially after starting a job and making money. This is a real, normal struggle. If we’re serious about honoring God with our finances, we should invest in Kingdom activities (church, missionaries, etc). Do your best with this question. I fear that shame will keep people quiet if they do not currently give.\nRejoicing\nContentment\nV13 - in light of being in different situations, good and bad\nWhat did the Philippians do\nGiving and generosity, but also partnership\nGenerous because God is generous to us\n1.  What is Paul rejoicing in?\nPaul is joyful that the Philippians have revived their concern for him through a financial gift sent with Epaphroditus.\n2.  Many people think of Philippians as a thank you letter. Yet Paul never thanks the Philippians for their partnership with them. Here he says he “rejoiced in the Lord” for their concern. What does that tell you about Paul’s perspective on their financial help?\nHe knows that their ability and desire to give ultimately comes from God. He probably is thankful to the Philippians, but he is more eager to express his delight that God is at work in them.\n3.  Why would it be significant for the Philippians to know that Paul is not rejoicing because they alleviated his need? (Hint: revisit the question “What is he specifically rejoicing for?”)\nPaul is not rejoicing because he was in desperate need and suddenly things are better. He wants that Philippians to know that their gift is a cause for rejoicing because their gift shows that their faith is genuine and that they are trusting God.\n4.  What is Paul’s secret to contentment and strength? How does this work?\nHe does all things through “him”, i.e. Christ, who strengthens him. As Paul moves through life, he knows that God loves him and that Christ died for him. He knows that when he dies he will go to be with the Lord. So whether he lived or dies, has comfort or suffering, he has a source of hope and joy in Christ that energizes him to fulfill any work God calls him to.\nExplore – Read 4:14-20 [Generosity Unleashed Through God’s Generosity]\n5.  How does Paul describe his relationship with the Philippians? How is his relationship with them unique among the churches he planted?\nMost churches didn’t give, but the Philippians entered into a partnership with Paul to support his ministry.\n6.  What is the difference between volunteering or donating and entering into partnership with someone?\nDonating or Volunteering can be more about the person donating than that need. Most problems cannot be solved by quick fixes, but God does amazing things through relationships, and a commitment to tackle a problem over time. In a partnership, you give not just your money or time, but your very self. The commitment to a relationship with someone offers a source of hope, encouragement, and possibility which is absent in one time gifts. One time gifts and opportunities are obviously great, only partnerships are more powerful.\n7.  What is Paul’s desire for the Philippians in their partnership? What is he seeking for them?\nHe is seeking that they might have credit with God. He is more concerned about their relationships with God than his own situation. Paul may be receiving monetary help from the Philippians but what he is seeking is their good.\n8.  Why does Paul call their gift a fragrant offering, an acceptable sacrifice, and pleasing to God? Was it a gift to Paul or to God? How might the different perspectives affect someone’s giving?\nIt was a gift to both Paul and God. But ultimately when we give or serve, we are serving God not men. Our ultimate motivation is to please God. This is more important than even the help that we give to each other. The first question we have to ask is not “how can I help my fellow man?” but “how can I please God?”\n9.  Why is it significant for the Philippians to know that God will supply their needs?\nIf they were concerned about meeting their own needs, they would not be focused on meeting the needs of others. When we know God takes care of us we are free to care for others.\n10.  What might Paul want to emphasize about God’s generosity with the phrases, “according to his glorious riches in Christ Jesus?\nHe wants to emphasize that God gets glory for the way he pours out his riches on those who are in Christ. This helps emphasize to the Philippians and to us that God is not limited or stingy or reluctant to provide for us. He is gloriously rich and in Christ has bound himself to caring for his children.\n11.  How does God get glory when we are generous?\nWhen we are generous in the name of Jesus, we give glory to God because we highlight the fact that God has been generous to us. When we make it clear that God is generous he is glorified.", "source_path": "Philippians/Philippians 4_10-23.docx"}

The Lord is at hand;  6  do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God.  7  And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.\n8  Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think about these things.  9  What you have learned and received and heard and seen in me—practice these things, and the God of peace will be with you.\nIcebreaker of your choice!\nWhy would Paul talk about v4-7 after addressing the situation in v2-3?\nV4-7 talks about rejoicing, being reasonable, not being anxious, praying, and peace. These are things that were probably lacking with these faithful women. Conflict can bring out very “un-Christian” attitudes within us.\nHow have we seen conflict deal with at church? At college fellowships? At work? In general?\nEncourage people to share. Having your own anecdote would be ideal. People might be very non-confrontational so they don’t “do” anything in conflict, but they will definitely have an emotional reaction in conflict. It would be worth to explore how people felt during such conflicts. Lean towards church conflicts if possible, but if people are not sharing then open up the restriction.\nHow could v4-7 apply to our conflicts?\nIn conflict, we may get super absorbed in the wrongdoing that we do not seek the Lord or even think about joy. In addition, many times conflict makes us unreasonable. We hold grudges and become bitter. Peace no longer becomes a trait that describes us, especially as Christians.\nWhat are some things that make us anxious? What is our default way of dealing with anxiety?\nSimilar to question 2, examples are needed here. Be willing to share your own example. Definitely affirm people as they share. Their experiences and feelings are legitimate. Even if the source of their anxiety seems small or silly to us, affirm how they felt. We also want to highlight how our default response to anxiety is not always prayer. Many times we just ignore or bury it or distract ourselves. Bringing these in prayer forces us to allow God to take control in these circumstances; it is an act of trust. Peace can then follow in the midst of anxious circumstances.\n(If you have time)  What does this ‘peace of God’ look like in these situations?\nDoes not mean that things are perfect or smooth. It means that we can trust that God is still in control even when we are disappointed or when things are unsure. Ask if anyone has experienced this before. Oftentimes, this is not something we experience 100% of the time as Christians. There are times we will experience this more vividly but it is a deliberate, day by day, choice for us to trust and surrender in prayer.\nRejoice? Reasonableness? Not anxious? Relating to unity\nPeace and prayer\nApply to conflicts (church, work, campus fellowship)\nWhere do you go first when feeling anxious?\nTypes of anxiety?\n1.  Why do you think Paul makes such a public display of these women? Why is he so concerned for unity in the Philippian church?\nAs Paul explained in chapter 1 & 2, unity is critical for the spread of the gospel. Disagreements keep us from supporting one another in the hard work of the ministry. Paul needs to be sure that this situation will be taken care of immediately and he trusts that the church is mature enough to handle it publically.\n2.  What does it mean to “agree in the Lord”?\nYou don’t need to agree on everything, but agreeing in the Lord means that you value the things that you agree upon because of your shared connection to Christ more than you value the things that you disagree upon.\n3.  What is the basis of Paul’s appeal to these women? Why might it be significant that they each labored with Paul or that their names are in the book of life?\nHe is continuing to build a case for their connectedness. Seeing that they have both labored with Paul implies that they are ultimately about the same work of the spread of the gospel. They are both heirs of eternal life and if nothing else better learn to get along because they will be with each other forever.\nExplore – Read 4:4-9 [Peace in Our Hearts and Minds]\n4.  What does it mean to rejoice in the Lord? Why do you think he specifies “always”? Describe how it might be possible to do this even in hard times.\nRejoicing in the Lord is rejoicing because in the experience of Jesus himself. The reason you can do this always is that neither Christ nor our relationship with him ever changes, for those who are Christ’s. Even though circumstances change we can always rejoice in Jesus. Sometimes our circumstances are so painful it is difficult to rejoice in anything, even Jesus. Other times our circumstances are so good that it is hard to rejoice in Jesus because we are satisfied elsewhere. But it is always possible to rejoice in him\n5.  Why do you think Paul is so serious about showing our “reasonableness” or “gentleness” and “being anxious for nothing”? Why would he mention this in this context? (Hint: Think back to Euodia and Syntyche. Are anxious people reasonable or easy to get along with? How would disunity in the church affect their witness to the outside world? How would anxiety?)\nPaul wants the “reasonableness” of the Philippians publicly displayed so that people can see the impact walking with Christ has in someone's life. If they continue to be unreasonable with each other and inflexible, they would tear apart the unity of the church and take energy away from the preaching of the gospel.\n6.  How does praying bring peace? Is it because God promises to answer our every request or is it something else? (Hint: Why would prayers that bring peace have to be done “with thanksgiving”? When you think about praying, why is it important to remember “the Lord is near”?)\nMost of the times our anxieties are caused by failing to recognize God in the situation. When we bring our anxieties to God, we realize that none of them are worthy of fretting over in light of the awesome power and goodness of God to us. Even if things do not fall out for us the way we pray for them, just knowing that God has been called upon to deal with the situation comforts us. Additionally, coming to God with thanksgiving reminds us that no situation is really completely bad and worth our anxiety.\n7.  What do our hearts and minds need to be guarded or protected from? How are we guarded “in Christ Jesus”?\nOur hearts are under attack by anxious thoughts. Here Paul pictures them as invaders. Christ stands as guard at the threshold of our minds and hearts forbidding that any anxious, unbelieving thoughts should enter. The picture of Christ guarding us is of course metaphorical. He protects us from anxiety by assuring us of God’s love for us on account of his blood, and using his authority to bring about our ultimate good.\n8.  How might it affect the lives of the Philippians to live out Paul’s command in verse 8? How might it affect the gospel ministry in Philippi? How might it affect the relationship between Euodia and Syntyche?\nThey would be unaffected by suffering, captured by thoughts of Christ and the spread of the gospel. They would be hopeful, and energetic in the preaching of the gospel. It would bring peace, as people looked past each other’s faults, dwelling on forgiveness and mercy, putting away thoughts of violence and revenge.\n9.  Try and come up with antonyms for each of these adjectives in verse 8. How does this clarify what Paul is talking about? Do any examples come to mind?\n10.  Why does Paul place such an emphasis on the life of the mind (1:27, 2:2, 2:5, 3:15, 3:19, 4:8)? How does the mind fit into our experience of God, or our ability to live a life worthy of the gospel?\nThe mind is where we sort out everything we know about Jesus and the world. If our mind is filled with lies about God or ourselves we will never be able to live the lives God has for us. The mind is the place our souls work out our passions, our designs, our values.\n11.  What does it look like for the God of peace to be with someone? Why would this happen as a result of following Paul’s teaching and example? How could Paul be so sure?\nThe person experiences God as a peace giver. This happens ultimately from believing Paul’s gospel. Paul’s life was all about the gospel. His pattern of life was a gospel-centered life.", "source_path": "Philippians/Philippians 4_2-9.docx"}

Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow: they neither toil nor spin,  29  yet I tell you, even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.  30  But if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today is alive and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will he not much more clothe you, O you of little faith?  31  Therefore do not be anxious, saying, ‘What shall we eat?’ or ‘What shall we drink?’ or ‘What shall we wear?’  32  For the Gentiles seek after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them all.  33  But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.\n34  “Therefore do not be anxious about tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself.

Why do you think Jesus included this portion in his sermon?\nJesus is addressing the normal concerns of people. God cares about these “basic” needs as well and Jesus wants people to understand that. Note that although we may not be anxious about having a next meal, there are people today (and especially back then) where there were legitimate concerns about the next meal.\nList some hardships that people go through.\nGeneral hardships. We can think of things like lack of food, finances, comforts, homelessness, etc. But we can also talk about ones that are more immediate to us like emotional hardship, losss, suffering, different sources of anxiety, etc.\nWe are shaped by the good and bad circumstances in life that we can categorize. Looking at the concentric circles below, what good and bad things would you categorize in each circle?\nTake time for people to think and share. Hopefully people can be more personal with their answers, especially since question 2 was already more general.\nWhat does the “world” mean in this context? How does the “world” contribute to the difficulty of life? Where have you seen this manifest?\nAlthough God’s kingdom includes the literal world, the term refers to the things that are against God and not according to what He wants on earth. The world is tainted with sin so it causes suffering and hardship. There are difficulties and hardships that are not directly caused by human beings like sickness, natural disaster, accidents, etc.\nWith the different difficulties in life, we are not supposed to carry them alone. What do you find difficult in bringing needs to other people? What do you find difficult in bringing needs to God?\nThere are definitely potential difficulties when we bring in others for support during hardships. It would be good to get personal examples for this section. Groups can even compare/contrast what it’s like to bring difficulties to God vs others. The goal is to establish that we are needy and that life has hardships. There isn’t necessarily a “solution” for this week apart from acknowledging that we need one another and need God.", "source_path": "Side by Side/20220708 Introduction + Ch1.docx"}

Through a variety of images, Scripture shows us how our hearts function. What do we learn about the heart\nfrom the following images (see pp. 23–24):\n• fountainhead (Prov. 4:23)\n• well (Prov. 20:5; John 7:38)\n• tree (Jer. 17:5–8)\n• treasure chest (Matt. 6:19–21)\n3. How do our emotions reveal what is most dear to us? Why is it important and helpful to pinpoint what triggers strong emotions in both ourselves and those we wish to help?\n4. Why does offering help include seeing what is good in the one we wish to help?\n5. Making a case from Scripture (Ex. 34:6; Rom. 2:15), Welch writes, “There is no such thing as independence”\n(p. 29). How does this truth shape your thinking about life’s overarching purpose and the goals you set?\n6. An accurate knowledge of God is the most important thing we can ever have, and it’s something Paul prays for\nin Ephesians (1:16–17; 3:14–19). How do the petitions in Paul’s prayers line up with how you pray for yourself\nand for others?\nHow are feelings linked to what is happening in your relationship with God?\nWhat are some common responses/conversations we have with God when going through suffering?\n1. How can our faith actually change our experience of suffering? (See p. 34.)\n2. How do Jesus’s suffering and his cries to God shed light on our path as we face our own suffering? How does\nPsalm 22 help in this regard?\n3. How did Jesus wage spiritual battle during his earthly suffering? See Psalm 22:3–5, 9–10 and Matthew 4:1–11.\n4. Review Psalm 22 in its entirety. How does the conversation of the sufferer progress through the psalm?\n5. Welch writes, “Hope is one of our most valued responses to the difficulties of life” (p. 40). Why is that true?\n(See Romans 5:1–5.)\nYAR8 - 20220729\nNo need to rush through all of the questions! Allow people to take time to answer. With smaller groups, we can encourage more engagement. You can cater the questions and make them “easier” or more accessible or less invasive if people are shy to answer.\nStart with an icebreaker!\nSample: If you had all the money/resources available, what unique or niche thing would you do or buy?\nWhat is the “heart”? In what ways are our hearts always busy or active?\n“Center” or source of our being - It’s where emotions come from as well as good and bad. From the ‘heart’ will come outward action and words.\nOur hearts are busy and active because we engage with so many things per day. We react to events and people around us; some planned and some unplanned. When we see that there’s good, bad, fear, frustrations, joys, sorrows, we can see how our hearts are busy.\nWe get occupied by stuff, people, emotions, commitments.\nHow do our emotions reveal what is most dear to us? Why is it important and helpful to pinpoint what triggers strong emotions in ourselves? How have you seen your emotions show you what you see as important?\nAny strong emotion reveals what we’re really focused on, what we care about, what we prioritize, what we value, what we’re afraid to lose. They show us how we feel about different relationships (with people/objects/God)\nHelps us know ourselves and where we need God to help us overcome certain idols or things not from Him.\nSeek examples!\nHow are feelings linked to your relationship with God?\nNote that a good relationship with God does not mean our feelings are 100% good, nor does it mean that a bad relationship with God means our feelings are negative. Feelings give us an indicator of how things are going with God. Feelings can affect how we approach and handle our relationship with God. Maybe ask for examples how feelings affect how we approach God.\nSome examples:\nNumbness… apathy… Pushes us to seek God\nSmooth emotions - are we seeking God still? Do we feel like we need him?\nRough emotions (suffering or difficulty) - am I seeking God for help?\nWhat are some common responses/conversations we have with God when going through difficulties or suffering?\nSometimes we only converse with God when we’re going through difficulties.\nLamenting, self pity, complaining\nQuestioning God or God’s plan\nHelp, deliver me now\nDo we respond with trusting God?\nREAD Psalm 22:1-5, 19-31 (maybe twice if there is time)\nLook at Psalm 22. How does the conversation of the sufferer progress through the psalm?\nContext: Written by David who has experienced/is experiencing some pursuit by enemies. Exact situation is unknown.\nLament/yell at God —Acknowledging/reminding who God is/what he has done — Pleading for deliverance — Everyone should praise God\nNote that this is not a progression when dealing with difficulties. They are distinct components\nHow can this inform us how to approach difficulties and suffering?\nWe need not be afraid to go to God with our difficulties. He can handle our issues, and he can handle our complaining/venting. Perhaps ask people what their default approach to difficulties is.", "source_path": "Side by Side/20220729 Ch 2 + 3.docx"}

Those benefits are as follows:\n• Seeing the weight of our sin drives us to Jesus.\n• Seeing the weight of our sin brings humility.\n• Seeing the weight of our sin is the beginning of power and confidence.\n5. Welch writes, “Throughout biblical history, God has graciously let his people see the realities of their hearts”\n(p. 46).

Why is confession of sin a necessary daily activity?\nYAR8 - Ch 4\nJames 4:1-10\n1  What causes quarrels and what causes fights among you? Is it not this, that your passions are at war within you?  2  You desire and do not have, so you murder. You covet and cannot obtain, so you fight and quarrel. You do not have, because you do not ask.  3  You ask and do not receive, because you ask wrongly, to spend it on your passions.  4  You adulterous people! Do you not know that friendship with the world is enmity with God? Therefore whoever wishes to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God.  5  Or do you suppose it is to no purpose that the Scripture says, “He yearns jealously over the spirit that he has made to dwell in us”?  6  But he gives more grace. Therefore it says, “God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble.”  7  Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.  8  Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded.  9  Be wretched and mourn and weep. Let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to gloom.  10  Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will exalt you.\nWhat sticks out to you in this passage? What sins are described in James 4? Who do these sins describe?\nMurder, envy, covetousness, worldly passions. Describing church people; there should be a shock factor here. Unsure if James is referring to an actual event, but it’s still surprising to associate these Christians with such sins.\nWhy don’t we like to talk  with others  about sin?  With God ?\nOthers - Reputation could be ruined, ruining the vibes; uncomfortable, comparison, don’t want to be a burden\nGod - feeling defeated over repeated sin, don’t feel heard, unwilling to separate from sin\nBoth - embarrassing, complacent/apathy towards sin, don’t want to confront\nKeeping things relatively general still, but we are trying to verbalize what people actually feel. People may not consciously think about these reasons we don’t talk about sin, but hopefully this group brainstorm can help us all identify for ourselves.\nWhat blessings come from seeing the weight of our sin? How is sin weighty?\nPeople might not understand what it means for sin to be weighty. Look to talk about that first. It may be hard for people to wrap their minds around this, but try to have a conversation about how we see sin (seriousness of it or lack thereof).\nSeeing weight of sin lets us see just how much it affects us and others (potentially) long term\nIt can potentially scare us from wanting to continue sinning\nHelps us see our need and weakness ->  humility to turn to Jesus -> sanctification\nSin is weighty because it offends a weighty God; Sin is weighty because we have a lot\n-people naturally avoid acknowledging sin for different reasons\n-full acknowledgement of our wrongdoings, wrong thoughts would be heavy\nWelch writes, “Throughout biblical history, God has graciously let his people see the realities of their hearts” (p. 46).

This status helps Christians recognize that they are not strong on their own and need God/others, aka needy. At the same time, if we recognize this status in people as a whole, we see that we need to help our fellow “weak” human, aka needed.\nWhat are some qualifications of people who have helped you in the past? What made them so helpful?\nGood demeanor (calm, friendly)\nWent above and beyond what you expected; sacrificed time and energy\nThey were willing to help and were bold to step up, sometimes unintentionally\nTook time to know my situation and did their best to find resources\nGive a tangible example of when you had help – we’re trying to get at the fact that people aren’t necessarily “professional helpers”\nWho is the main actor in this passage? How does God move towards you?\nGod is the actor in the passage; he does the verbs\nHe choose us even when we are low and despised\nHe reaches you when you are humble and not prideful\nHe sent Jesus, he has called various prophets throughout the Bible\nHe draws near when we need comfort or conviction\nAgain, share and gather examples!\nTransition to next question: Because God moves towards us, we move toward other people\nWhat is difficult about moving towards people?

We want to “play it safe” and retreat quickly\nThey may not accept you/ move away from you, or dump emotional baggage\nWe might feel underqualified, we don’t think it’s our job\nJust easier to talk to people I know and avoid the “other”\nGive a personal experience!

What are some good and bad practices when greeting someone else?\nGood: make the conversation about them, allow them to share, make them feel important, take the time to learn about the person\nIntroduce that person to other people\nIf you do get someone’s contact info, follow up\nBad: coming in with intention other than a friendly greeting, pushing someone to another person right away\nDon’t make them uncomfortable, don’t challenge or offend, avoid microaggression\nDon’t stalk them\nGive personal experience", "source_path": "Side by Side/20220812 Ch 7 + 8.docx"}

What does it reveal about God in relation to us? How does this revelation about God impact our relationship with him (and with others)?\nGod intimately knows us. He created us and knows every part of our being. He is not distant; he pursues us when we are far. Nothing is hidden from him.\nHe can see and understand what we are going through.\nWe can be comfortable and free before God as he already knows us.\nHow God treats us is how we should treat people around us – knowing people more deeply as he knows us\nTransition question: How do we do this?  Diving deeper with others through conversation\nWhat is your default reaction when a conversation becomes stale or stagnant or awkward?\nPanic; retreat; silence; keep talking; changing topic; phone a friend; abruptly end; excuses to exit; stalling of some sort. Feel free to share personal examples. We’re not trying to shame anyone in their ability to converse. If anything, we’re laughing at ourselves and expressing that this is a common struggle.\nWhat are some of your go-to conversation starters? How effective have they been? If you’re seeing that they’re not very effective, how will you revise them?\nWork/school, name, weekly activities, plan for weekend/vacation, hobbies, background, interests, how they came to YAF/church\nSome effective things: Not asking yes/no questions. Talking/asking questions back. Not too surface-y topics like the weather.\nEngage/respond with their responses\nPersonal examples and failures are good here.\nNote that these strategies are typically used with people you don’t know (that well) or you’re welcoming some new person. When talking with people you’re comfortable with, you’re not thinking about conversations in this manner.\nHow do we move from generic conversation starters to more personal conversations?\nActually pay attention and listen to them - then follow up through regular care\nRegular “smaller” care - this can be checking in with people and seeing how they are doing. Remembering and asking about something they told you previously.\nActually want to know them deeper; be genuine. If we are ‘faking’ trying to get personal, it’s not going to go anywhere.\nAsking good/deeper questions; be willing to share yourself! Someone has to initiate and take the ‘risk’ in sharing/asking deeper things.\nNote that being ‘friends’ is not a prerequisite to having such conversations.\nExamples from your life?\nWhat happens next after the conversation gets more personal?\nExchange contact if needed and follow up (at healthy intervals) – even if they stop showing up. This is a form of caring.\nListen even more and be present - these are the same basic skills that are even more important the deeper you go.\nPraying - this type of praying isn’t just a simple “explain request and pray for it.” True prayer as care is being able to understand someone’s life or struggle such that you can accurately verbalize their experience (incl. the emotional/mental/spiritual components) where he or she feels completely heard and seen. This allows us to effectively pray for someone almost as if we were him or her. Such prayer as care is regular, potentially daily, and helps us be intimately involved and present in someone’s life. The vice versa is also true for us allowing someone else to care for us.", "source_path": "Side by Side/20220826 Ch 9.docx"}

Welch writes, “Sickness is always a spiritual matter in that it raises questions about God’s care and goodness, and it is an opportunity to grow in trust and obedience” (pp. 115–16).

Though our outer self is wasting away, our inner self is being renewed day by day.   17  For this light momentary affliction is preparing for us an eternal weight of glory beyond all comparison,   18  as we look not to the things that are seen but to the things that are unseen. For the things that are seen are transient, but the things that are unseen are eternal.\nThis is a common passage when addressing suffering.

On page 126 we read, “Since we have the Spirit, the Word, and prayer, we can be hopeful and stand firm against Satan as we go through our daily wildernesses.” How can we live this out practically?\n4. Why does suffering tend to summon Satan? How does Ephesians 6:10–18 equip us to counter his attacks?\n5.
