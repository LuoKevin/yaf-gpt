Ask the Lord of the harvest, therefore, to send out workers into his harvest field. 3 Go! I am sending you out like lambs among wolves. 4 Do not take a purse or bag or sandals; and do not greet anyone on the road. 5 “When you enter a house, first say, ‘Peace to this house.’ 6 If someone who promotes peace is there, your peace will rest on them; if not, it will return to you. 7 Stay there, eating and drinking whatever they give you, for the worker deserves his wages. Do not move around from house to house. 8 “When you enter a town and are welcomed, eat what is offered to you. 9 Heal the sick who are there and tell them, ‘The kingdom of God has come near to you.’ 10 But when you enter a town and are not welcomed, go into its streets and say, 11 ‘Even the dust of your town we wipe from our feet as a warning to you. Yet be sure of this: The kingdom of God has come near.’ 12 I tell you, it will be more bearable on that day for Sodom than for that town. 13 “Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes. 14 But it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment than for you. 15 And you, Capernaum, will you be lifted to the heavens? No, you will go down to Hades. 16 “Whoever listens to you listens to me; whoever rejects you rejects me; but whoever rejects me rejects him who sent me.” 17 The seventy-two returned with joy and said, “Lord, even the demons submit to us in your name.” 18 He replied, “I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven. 19 I have given you authority to trample on snakes and scorpions and to overcome all the power of the enemy; nothing will harm you. 20 However, do not rejoice that the spirits submit to you, but rejoice that your names are written in heaven.” 21 At that time Jesus, full of joy through the Holy Spirit, said, “I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and learned, and revealed them to little children. Yes, Father, for this is what you were pleased to do. 22 “All things have been committed to me by my Father. No one knows who the Son is except the Father, and no one knows who the Father is except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.” 23 Then he turned to his disciples and said privately, “Blessed are the eyes that see what you see. 24 For I tell you that many prophets and kings wanted to see what you see but did not see it, and to hear what you hear but did not hear it.”", "source_path": "Luke/Luke 10_1-24.docx"}

But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and felt compassion, and ran and embraced him and kissed him.  21  And the son said to him, ‘Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son.’  22  But the father said to his servants, ‘Bring quickly the best robe, and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet.  23  And bring the fattened calf and kill it, and let us eat and celebrate.  24  For this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found.’ And they began to celebrate.\n25  “Now his older son was in the field, and as he came and drew near to the house, he heard music and dancing.  26  And he called one of the servants and asked what these things meant.  27  And he said to him, ‘Your brother has come, and your father has killed the fattened calf, because he has received him back safe and sound.’  28  But he was angry and refused to go in. His father came out and entreated him,  29  but he answered his father, ‘Look, these many years I have served you, and I never disobeyed your command, yet you never gave me a young goat, that I might celebrate with my friends.  30  But when this son of yours came, who has devoured your property with prostitutes, you killed the fattened calf for him!’  31  And he said to him, ‘Son, you are always with me, and all that is mine is yours.  32  It was fitting to celebrate and be glad, for this your brother was dead, and is alive; he was lost, and Is found.’”", "source_path": "Luke/Luke 15.11-32.docx"}

The rich man also died and was buried.  23  And being in torment in Hades, he looked up and saw Abraham a long way off, with Lazarus at his side.  24  ‘Father Abraham!’ he called out, ‘Have mercy on me and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, because I am in agony in this flame!  25  “‘Son,’ Abraham said, ‘remember that during your life you received your good things, just as Lazarus received bad things, but now he is comforted here, while you are in agony.  26  Besides all this, a great chasm has been fixed between us and you, so that those who want to pass over from here to you cannot; neither can those from there cross over to us.  27  “‘Father,’ he said, ‘then I beg you to send him to my father’s house—  28  because I have five brothers—to warn them, so that they won’t also come to this place of torment.  29  “But Abraham said, ‘They have Moses and the prophets; they should listen to them.’  30  “‘No, father Abraham,’ he said. ‘But if someone from the dead goes to them, they will repent.’  31  “But he told him, ‘If they don’t listen to Moses and the prophets, they will not be persuaded if someone rises from the dead.’”\nIce Breaker: When have you alerted someone of a potential danger? (It can be really minor, like a wet floor)\nContext:\nParable of the Dishonest Manager and Pharisees’ reaction to it\nRich man- purple, linen\nCeremonial uncleanliness- poor man was covered with sores, licked by dogs\nThis is a different Lazarus from the one Jesus rose from the dead\nJews didn’t have a concept of “heaven” like we do, their vision of desired afterlife was to be reunited with their great ancestors like Abraham, Jacob, Moses, etc.\nQuestions:\nHow does the rich man use his money while he’s alive?\nBuys and dresses in the nicest clothes\nBuys and eats the nicest food\nGenerally spends all his resources on himself\nWhat do the rich man’s actions in the afterlife reveal about how he views Lazarus? What about when both were alive?\nAsks Abraham to command Lazarus to help him instead of asking Lazarus directly\nRecognizes Lazarus by name, suggesting that the rich man was familiar with who he was\nGenerally shows how the rich man looks down on Lazarus in the afterlife, and likely did while they were both alive\nWhy did the rich man end up where he is after death? What needed to change for his fate to be different?\nWhile alive, the rich man was familiar with who Lazarus was and his situation, but never bothered to help him even with the leftovers he had\nThe issue was not about how much or little he helped, but rather  why  the rich man didn’t help Lazarus\nThe rich man was only interested in doing things and spending his resources in ways that would bring benefit or satisfaction back to himself\nThe rich man lacked a compassionate heart, which is why he was never interested in helping Lazarus\nWhat needed to change was the entirety of the rich man’s heart and priorities, not just his interactions with Lazarus\nWhy does the rich man want to warn his brothers? How does Abraham respond to his request?\nRich man realizes that it’s too late for him to be with Abraham anymore, but still hopes his brothers still have the chance\nRich man thinks that if his brothers see Lazarus resurrected that would help them reach a different fate after death\nAbraham tells the rich man that even seeing someone come back from the dead wouldn’t be enough to change the fate of his brothers\nThe rich man believes that if his brothers act somewhat differently in life that it would lead to them having a different experience after death\nAbraham explains that the issue with the rich man’s brothers is with their hearts, just like the rich man himself\nWhat does Christian compassion look like? Why is it important?\nChristian compassion looks like caring for someone  even/especially when it’s not convenient to do so\nOnly serving others when it’s easy or doesn’t come at a cost to ourselves isn’t really compassion, but instead convenience\nGood example is parable of the Good Samaritan\nTrue compassion is also the mark of a heart changed by the Gospel\nWhile having compassion doesn’t earn righteousness or salvation, it’s a measuring point for how much your heart is changed by God\nHow have you personally seen an example of this kind of compassion in your life?\nCARE GROUP\nWhere’s an area of your life that you see an opportunity to show more of this kind of compassion?

No one is good except God alone. 20 You know the commandments: ‘Do not commit adultery, Do not murder, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honor your father and mother.’” 21 And he said, “All these I have kept from my youth.” 22 When Jesus heard this, he said to him, “One thing you still lack.

The crooked roads shall become straight,     the rough ways smooth.\n6  And all people will see God’s salvation.’” [ a ]\n7  John said to the crowds coming out to be baptized by him, “You brood of vipers!

But one who is more powerful than I will come, the straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie. He will baptize you with [ c ]  the Holy Spirit and fire.  17  His winnowing fork is in his hand to clear his threshing floor and to gather the wheat into his barn, but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.”  18  And with many other words John exhorted the people and proclaimed the good news to them.\n19  But when John rebuked Herod the tetrarch because of his marriage to Herodias, his brother’s wife, and all the other evil things he had done,  20  Herod added this to them all: He locked John up in prison.\nThe Baptism and Genealogy of Jesus\n21  When all the people were being baptized, Jesus was baptized too.

How are they similar?\nJohn is preparing, Jesus is saving\nJohn is baptizing with water, Jesus baptizes with the Spirit and fire\nJesus’s is compared to using a winnowing fork, in which souls are separated /purged/ judged.

Was this normal? Why stand up to read?\nIV Answer: The tradition in the synagogues of Jesus’ day was not to have a regular minister/preacher for each synagogue, but rather to have the Scripture read and discussed. Often a distinguished visitor was asked to read the Scripture and comment on it.\nIn order to appreciate what happens here, one must understand the synagogue service order. Our knowledge of such a service comes from ancient Jewish sources such as the Misb-nab, the Jewish codification of their oral law.\n10 men must be present. Recite the Shemah from Dueterotomy, share prayers such as the tephillah. Then a reading from the Torah, and from the prophets. Then an exposition to tie it together, and ends with a benediction. Jesus was probably reading during the exposition section.\nWhat did Jesus do in capernaum?\nExplain the context of V24-27. Elijah, drought, Elisha\nWhy did everyone seem to change their mind about Jesus from saying “spoke well of him” to driving him out of town? Ready to throw him off a cliff.\nThey praised him and are impressed by him and his teachings, but didn’t necessarily believe him. Which is still somewhat true today.  TGC Answer:\n(1) Jesus does not cite the entirety of Isaiah 61:2, omitting a reference to coming judgment;\n(2) Jesus cites Isaiah 58:6 instead, claiming authority not only to announce but also to accomplish salvation; and\n(3) he refers to Elijah and Elisha (Luke 4:24–27), who ministered during a time of large-scale rebellion by Israel against God\nIV Ans: In verses 25-27, Jesus is referring to two Old Testament stories (1 Kings 17:1-24 and 2 Kings 5:1-14) that would be familiar to the people then but are not so familiar to us. Look closely at the two people who receive ministry: the widow at Zarephath in Sidon in verse 26, and Naaman the Syrian leper in verse 27. What do they have in common? (They were both Gentiles.)

And when he saw Jesus, he fell on his face and begged him, “Lord, if you will, you can make me clean.” 13 And Jesus stretched out his hand and touched him, saying, “I will; be clean.” And immediately the leprosy left him. 14 And he charged him to tell no one, but “go and show yourself to the priest, and make an offering for your cleansing, as Moses commanded, for a proof to them.” 15 But now even more the report about him went abroad, and great crowds gathered to hear him and to be healed of their infirmities. 16 But he would withdraw to desolate places and pray.", "source_path": "Luke/Luke 5_1-16.docx"}

They tried to bring him in and set him down before him.  19  Since they could not find a way to bring him in because of the crowd, they went up on the roof and lowered him on the stretcher through the roof tiles into the middle of the crowd before Jesus.  20  Seeing their faith he said, “Friend, your sins are forgiven.”  21  Then the scribes and the Pharisees began to think to themselves, “Who is this man who speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins but God alone?”  22  But perceiving their thoughts, Jesus replied to them, “Why are you thinking this in your hearts?  23  Which is easier: to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Get up and walk’?  24  But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins”—he told the paralyzed man, “I tell you: Get up, take your stretcher, and go home.”  25  Immediately he got up before them, picked up what he had been lying on, and went home glorifying God.  26  Then everyone was astounded, and they were giving glory to God. And they were filled with awe and said, “We have seen incredible things today.”  27  After this, Jesus went out and saw a tax collector named Levi sitting at the tax office, and he said to him, “Follow me.”  28  So, leaving everything behind, he got up and began to follow him.  29  Then Levi hosted a grand banquet for him at his house. Now there was a large crowd of tax collectors and others who were reclining at the table with them.  30  But the Pharisees and their scribes were complaining to his disciples, “Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?”  31  Jesus replied to them, “It is not those who are healthy who need a doctor, but those who are sick.  32  I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.”", "source_path": "Luke/Luke 5_17-32.docx"}

Then a fierce windstorm came down on the lake; they were being swamped and were in danger.  24  They came and woke him up, saying, “Master, Master, we’re going to die!” Then he got up and rebuked the wind and the raging waves. So they ceased, and there was a calm.  25  He said to them, “Where is your faith?” They were fearful and amazed, asking one another, “Who then is this? He commands even the winds and the waves, and they obey him!”  26  Then they sailed to the region of the Gerasenes, which is opposite Galilee.  27  When he got out on land, a demon-possessed man from the town met him. For a long time he had worn no clothes and did not stay in a house but in the tombs.  28  When he saw Jesus, he cried out, fell down before him, and said in a loud voice, “What do you have to do with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg you, don’t torment me!”  29  For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. Many times it had seized him, and though he was guarded, bound by chains and shackles, he would snap the restraints and be driven by the demon into deserted places.  30  “What is your name?” Jesus asked him. “Legion,” he said, because many demons had entered him.  31  And they begged him not to banish them to the abyss.  32  A large herd of pigs was there, feeding on the hillside. The demons begged him to permit them to enter the pigs, and he gave them permission.  33  The demons came out of the man and entered the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and drowned.  34  When the men who tended them saw what had happened, they ran off and reported it in the town and in the countryside.  35  Then people went out to see what had happened. They came to Jesus and found the man the demons had departed from, sitting at Jesus’s feet, dressed and in his right mind. And they were afraid.  36  Meanwhile, the eyewitnesses reported to them how the demon-possessed man was delivered.  37  Then all the people of the Gerasene region asked him to leave them, because they were gripped by great fear. So getting into the boat, he returned.  38  The man from whom the demons had departed begged him earnestly to be with him. But he sent him away and said,  39  “Go back to your home, and tell all that God has done for you.” And off he went, proclaiming throughout the town how much Jesus had done for him.", "source_path": "Luke/Luke 8_22-39.docx"}
